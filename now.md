# Now

Right at this very moment I'm probably procrastinating when I should be writing [Centauri Womb](/projects/centauri-womb). That procrastination is currently taking the form of reading *Rhythm of War* by Brandon Sanderson. I'm also [running a lot of D&D online](https://startplaying.games/gm/cobbland).

*Inspired by [nownownow dot com](https://nownownow.com/about).*
