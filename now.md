# Now

Right at this very moment I'm probably procrastinating when I should be writing [Centauri Womb](/projects/centauri-womb). That procrastination is currently taking the form of: 

- Reading through all the Cosmere novels Brandon Sanderson and all the Star Wars novels from the ‘90s and ‘00s.
- Trying off and on to learn Thai.
- Practicing typing with the Colemak layout.
