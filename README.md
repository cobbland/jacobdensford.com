### Webmentions

I'm using [webmentions.io](https://webmention.io/) to receive webmentions and using [Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/) to send them. I haven't tested it all out yet, so I have no idea if it works or not. (I also might use [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) for social media integration, but we'll see.)

## Future Redesign

This won’t be for a while, hopefully. But here are some ideas I might want to use in a future redesign of my website.

- Make it look like a scifi UI somehow. Thin white lines around elements with transparent interiors and a spacescape background. Or something. (I got the idea from the Starfield youtube videos).
- Use variables for all my colors in the CSS. I don’t know how to do this, but I know it’s possible. Then I can change the colors at will in the future.
- Use the alpha channel for my main text (headings and p) and subtext (like subtitles and menus). Really, anything that isn’t one of the accent colors. I think it would look like color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95).
