This is my website. It compiles with 11ty and is hosted on netlify.

## Todo
- Update some of the subtitles, especially on Home, and maybe on About.
- Make a dark mode and maybe a way to switch to it. (#1F1F1F, #006C67, #C15300, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6) or something like that)
- Finish setting up my newsletter.
- transfer everything from old email address to new one.
- Find an elegant way to add a p-note to my homepage.
- Develop a system for processing my images and deploying the right one based on screen size.
- Figure out how to automatically display webmentions under my posts, and design a format for them.
- Figure out how to automatically display backlinks under my pages, and design a format for them.

## IndieWeb

### Webmentions

I'm using [webmentions.io](https://webmention.io/) to receive webmentions and using [Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/) to send them. I haven't tested it all out yet, so I have no idea if it works or not. (I also might use [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) for social media integration, but we'll see.)

## Future Redesign

This wonâ€™t be for a while, hopefully. But here are some ideas I might want to use in a future redesign of my website.

- Make it look like a scifi UI somehow. Thin white lines around elements with transparent interiors and a spacescape background. Or something. (I got the idea from the Starfield youtube videos).
