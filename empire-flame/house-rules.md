# House Rules v4

## Modified Rules

### Beyond 1st Level

Rather than tracking experience points, leveling up happens after completing a number of play sessions or major milestones. One session or major milestone for 2nd and 3rd levels, two for 4th level, three for 5th through 10th, four for 11th through 16th, and five for 17th through 20th.

> **Alternate Option:** When you return to relative safety...
>
> - bearing significant plunder gained through deadly peril, or when you are paid for dangerous work, gain 1 XP per 1 gp of gold and treasure.
> - having rescued the innocent, gain 200 XP per soul saved.
> - after defeating monsters and overcoming traps, gain one tenth their listed XP.
>
> *When using this alternate option, humans gain a 10% boost to XP gained.*

When granted an ability score improvement class feature on any level other than 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, or 19th, it must be used for improving one of the class's primary abilities or starting saving throw proficient abilities (PH, 45).

*These rule modifies Beyond 1st Level (PH, 15).*

### Inspiration

Inspiration may be spent to gain advantage on an attack role, save, or ability check before or after making the initial roll.

Inspiration may be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, these situations grant inspiration more often:

- Acting out personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws, especially when such actions put characters in harm's way
- Solving problems in a unique, impressive, and clever way
- Overcoming a significant challenge or minor milestone

*These rule clarifies Inspiration (PH, 125).*

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

Donning and Doffing a shield only takes a bonus action.

*This rule modifies Getting Into and Out of Armor (PH, 146)*

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If you have advantage from more sources than you have disadvantage, you still have advantage. Inversely, if you have disadvantage from more sources than you have advantage, you still have disadvantage.

*This rule modifies Advantage and Disadvantage (PH, 173).*

### Proficiency Bonus

If a PC has both a skill and a tool proficiency that apply to a check, they may roll with advantage.

*This rule adds to Proficiency Bonus (PH, 173).*

### Ability Checks

Checks are only made when the task is possible to do and the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Also, if 5 plus the character's relevant modifiers (ability and proficiency bonuses) would meet or exceed the DC, the task is automatically successful without a roll. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a natural 1 is a **fumble** and always a failure and rolling a natural 20 is a **critical** and always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. Failing or succeeding a roll in such a way may introduce new complications or advantages.

Checks for a particular task can only be made twice. If the first character to try fails, one other person may try, as long as the first character didn't fumble. The two passed or failed checks represents all the efforts of the entire party combined.

Failing a roll doesn't always mean failing a check. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. Players may request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.

*These rule clarify and modify Ability Checks (PH, 174).*

### Passive Checks

Passive checks are not used. Instead, the DM will call for a roll when a check wouldn't automatically succeed or fail. In some cases, the DM may make such rolls on the player character's behalf in secret.

*This rule modifies Passive Checks (PH, 175).*

### Working Together

PCs can only help, granting a fellow PC advantage on a check, if they have proficiency in a relevant skill.

*This rule modifies Working Together (PH, 175).*

### Lifting and Carrying

PCs have a number of item slots equal to their Strength score. PCs carrying items that fill up to twice this many slots are encumbered, reducing their speed by ten feet. PCs carrying items that fill more are heavily encumbered, reducing their speed by twenty feet and imposing disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. PCs can never carry items that fill more than three times their Strength score in item slots.

Items that can be held in one hand use one slot. Items that require two hands to carry or wield use two slots. Small items can be bundled together into one slot. Tiny or very light items do not require a slot until they are collected in significant quantities. In general, every five pounds of equipment counts as one slot.

> **Examples of things that use 1 slot:**
>
> - 5 rations
> - 5 torches
> - 250 coins
> - 25 pieces of jewelry or gemstones
> - 25 arcanium or toxium
> - 20 arrows in a quiver
>
> **Examples of things that use 2 slots:**
>
> - two-handed weapons
? - armor

> **Alternate Option:** Simply use Variant: Encumbrance.

*These rules modify Lifting and Carrying (PH, 176) and uses parts of Variant: Encumbrance (PH, 176).*

### Saving Throws

If an effect grants a bonus to an ability check, be it numerical or advantage, that same bonus is applied to saving throws for that ability. In addition, if an effect grants a bonus to AC, that same bonus is applied to Dexterity saving throws.

*This rule modifies Saving Throws (PH, 179).*

### Darkvision

If a player character is granted darkvision from their race, they can see in dim light as if it were bright up to the listed range, but the range for seeing in darkness as if it were dim light is divided by six and rounded up to the nearest 5 foot increment (usually resulting in 10 feet).

*This rule modifies Dark Vision (PH, 183)*

### Resting

A character may spend one hit die after each hour of rest during a short or long rest to recover hit points. Hit dice spent during a long rest rest automatically restore their maximum amount of hit points.

*This rule modifies Resting (PH, 186).*

### Bonus Actions

Usually, any single small interaction that doesn't require a roll may be performed for free during an encounter as part of your movement and action. To do more, a bonus action may be used. A bonus action may also be used to perform any proficient skill checks.

*This rule modifies Bonus Actions (PH, 189).*

### Rolling 1 or 20

If the d20 roll for an attack is a natural 1, the target may make an opportunity attack using their reaction.

If the d20 roll for a saving throw is a natural 1, damage is dealt as a critical hit.

If the d20 roll for a saving throw is a natural 20, all harmful effects are avoided.

*These rules add to Rolling 1 or 20 (PH, 194).*

### Damage and Healing

Damage to hit points above half a character's hit point maximum is superficial, consisting of tiring cuts and bruises that leave no lasting signs of injury.

Damage to hit points below half a character's hit point maximum is more serious, representing injuries that may need medical attention. The character becomes **bloodied**â€”a condition that is visible to all.

Once a character is bloodied, one use of a healer's kit must be applied to them in order for them to naturally regain hit points using hit dice during a short or long rest, or regain hit dice during a long rest.

*These rules add to and modify Damage and Healing (PH, 196).*

### Critical Hits

A critical hit deals the maximum damage possible plus the result of rolling all the damage dice again.

*This rule modifies Critical Hits (PH, 196).*

### Dropping to Zero Hit Points

Without the use of magic, stabilizing a creature requires one use of a healer's kit and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. For each level of exhaustion, the DC increases by 5.

When a PC fails a death saving throw, they gain one level of exhaustion.

*These rules add to and modify Dropping to Zero Hit Points (PH, 197).*

### Material Spell Components

If a cost is listed for the material components needed for a spell, the listed components may be replaced with that many gold pieces worth of arcanium.

*This rule modifies Components (PH, 203)*

### Crafting Magic Items

Spend 25 gp and eight hours per day to create 25 arcanium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 arcana check (or a related check using the appropriate skill for the caster or spell, such as religion for a cleric crafting a holy weapon). Arcanium can be used during short or long rests to create a desired magical item whose gold value matches the arcanium spent.

*This rule modifies Crafting Magic Items (DMG, 129).*

### Identifying a Magic Item

*Use the variant rule: More Difficult Identification (DMG, 136).*

### Attunement

Characters can attune to a number of magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

*This rule modifies Attunement (DMG, 136).*

### Flanking

*Use the optional rule: Flanking (DMG, 251).*

### Crafting Poisons

To craft poisons, you must possess and be proficient with a poisoner's kit. Spend 25 gp and eight hours per day to create 25 toxium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 nature check. Toxium can be used during a short or long rest to create the desired poison whose gold value matches the toxium spent.

*This rule adds to Crafting and Harvesting Poisons (DMG, 258).*

## Additional Rules

### Luck Coins

Luck coins are a meta-currency that allow PCs to gain inspiration.

Luck coins are gained between sessions by completing the following tasks:

- Writing an in-character journal entry
- Writing a summery of the previous session
- Updating the oaken table
- Other tasks at the referee's discretion

Unspent luck coins expire after the following session.

### The Oaken Table

In the middle of the tavern sits an oaken table, upon which past adventurers have carved a map of the surrounding region. The PCs can carve additions into this map. They can also make a rubbing to be carried abroad. The oaken table can be a real object in the world or simply a metaphor. Either way, the dungeon master provides a map to the players that they may modify as they explore and gain new information.

### Pushing a Roll

To push a roll, a PC may gain one point of exhaustion to reroll their dice. They may keep rerolling and gaining additional points of exhaustion until they have six and begin making death saves.

They may also push at death's door, marking a failed death save in exchange for staying conscious long enough to automatically succeed at one action. They may continue to push in this way until accumulating three failed death saves, at which point they die.

### Time

When a play session ends in a safe location, it is up to the PCs how much in-game time passes before the next session. They should agree on a duration. In cases where consensus cannot be had, the average is taken.

When a play session ends with the PCs in a dangerous location, time is paused until the next session. Optionally, the PCs may decide to roll to return to safety, turning over to chance their riches and well-being. One of the PCs rolls a Wisdom (Survival) check, adding +1 for each of the following: they have mapped the way, they have cleared the way, they are well equipped, they are unencumbered. If they succeed, they return to safety unmolested. If they fail, they still return to safety, but at great cost.
