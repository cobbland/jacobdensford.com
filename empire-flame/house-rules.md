# House Rules

## Beyond 1st Level

Rather than tracking experience points, leveling up happens after completing a number of play sessions. One session for 2nd and 3rd levels, two sessions for 4th level, three sessions for 5th through 10th, four sessions for 11th through 16th, and five sessions for 17th through 20th. (Alternatevly, key milestones may be used instead or in addition, at the DM's discretion.)

When granted an ability score improvement class feature on any level other than 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, or 19th, it must be used for improving one of the class's primary abilities or starting saving throw profecient abilities (PH, 45), or for gaining a feat. (Other abilities may be improved at the DM's discretion if they are core to the character's concept.)

*This rule modifies Beyond 1st Level (PH, 15).*

## Inspiration

Inspiration can be spent to gain advantage on an attack role, save, or ability check before or after making the initial roll.

Inspiration can be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, these situations grant inspiration more often:

- Acting out personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws, especially when such actions put characters in harm's way
- Solving problems in a unique, impressive, and clever way

*This rule clarifies Inspiration (PH, 125).*

## Advantage and Disadvantage

If you have advantage from more sources than you have disadvantage, you still have advantage. Inversely, if you have disadvantage from more sources than you have advantage, you still have disadvantage.

*This rule modifies Advantage and Disadvantage (PH, 173).*

## Proficiency Bonus

If a PC has both a skill and a tool proficiency that apply to a check, they may roll with advantage.

*This rule adds to Proficiency Bonus (PH, 173).*

## Ability Checks

Checks are only made when the task is possible to do and the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Also, if 5 plus the character's relevant modifiers (ability and proficiency bonuses) would meet or exceed the DC, the task is automatically successful without a roll. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a 1 is always a failure and rolling a 20 is always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. Failing or succeeding a roll in such a way may introduce new complications or advantages.

Failing a roll doesn't always mean failing a check. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. Players can request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.

*This rule clarifies modifies Ability Checks (PH, 174).*

## Passive Checks

Passive checks are not used. Instead, the DM will call for a roll when a check wouldn't automatically succeed or fail. In rare cases, the DM may make such rolls on the player character's behalf in private.

*This rule modifies Passive Checks (PH, 175).*

## Working Together

PC's can only help, granting a fellow PC advantage on a skill check, if they possess a relevant skill.

*This rule modifies Working Together (PH, 175).*

## Saving Throws

If an effect grants a bonus to an ability check, be it numerical or advantage, that same bonus is applied to saving throws for that ability. In addition, if an effect grants a bonus to AC, be it numerical or advantage, that same bonus is applied to Dexterity saving throws.

*This rule modifies Saving Throws (PH, 179).*

## Bonus Actions

Usually, any small action that doesn't require a roll may be performed for free during an encounter. To do more, a bonus action may be used. A bonus action may also be used to perform any proficient skill checks.

*This rule modifies Bonus Actions (PH, 189).*

## Dropping to Zero Hit Points

When you are reduced to zero HP and then succeed on three death saving throws or are revived in some other way, you gain one level of exhaustion.

*This rule adds to Dropping to Zero Hit Points (PH, 197).*

## Crafting Magic Items

Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 arcanium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 arcana check. Arcanium can be used during short or long rests to create a desired magical item whose gold value matches the arcanium spent.

*This rule modifies Crafting Magic Items (DMG, 129).*

## Identifying a Magic Item

*Use the varient rule: More Difficult Identification (DMG, 136).*

## Attunement

Characters can attune to a number of magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

*This rule modifies Attunement (DMG, 136).*

## Crafting Poisons

To craft poisons, you must possess and be proficient with a poisoner's kit. Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 toxium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 nature check. Toxium can be used during a short or long rest to create the desired poison whose gold value matches the toxium spent.

To craft custom poisons, add up the total amount of toxium for a poison you wish to craft from the table below. Poisons are assumed to be applied via injury, be resisted with a DC 5 CON save, have conditions last for 1 round, deal no damage, and deal half damage on a successful save, unless other options are selected. (Further options can be requested at the DM's discretion. Such additional options will likely require challenges beyond a simple gold value to craft.)

Toxium|Effect
:---|---
25|The poison is applied by being ingested
50|The poison is applied by physical contact
100|The poison is applied by inhaling
50|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 10 CON save
100|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 15 CON save
200|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 20 CON save
300|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 25 CON save
50|The poison deals 1d4 poison damage
100|The poison deals 1d6 poison damage
150|The poison deals 1d8 poison damage
200|The poison deals 1d10 poison damage
250|The poison deals 1d12 poison damage
25|The poison's effects last for 1 minute
50|The poison's effects last for 1 hour
100|The poison's effects last for 1 day
200|The poison's effects last until treated
25|The poison causes one level of exhaustion
25|The poison causes the deafened condition
50|The poison causes the poisoned condition
50|The poison causes the blinded condition
75|The poison causes the frightened condition
100|The poison causes the charmed condition
125|The poison causes the incapacitated condition
150|The poison causes the stunned condition
175|The poison causes the paralyzed condition
200|The poison causes the unconscious condition

*This rule adds to Crafting and Harvesting Poisons (DMG, 258).*

## Optional House Rules

### Luck Coins

Luck coins are a meta-currency that allow PCs to gain inspiration.

Luck coins are gained between sessions by completing the following tasks:

- Writing an in-character journal entry
- Writing a summery of the previous session
- Updating the oaken table
- Other tasks at the referee's discretion

Unspent luck coins expire after the following session.

### The Oaken Table

In the middle of the tavern sits an oaken table, upon which past adventurers have carved a map of the surrounding region. The PCs can carve additions into this map. They can also make a rubbing to be carried abroad. The oaken table can be a real object in the world or simply a metaphor. Either way, the dungeon master provides a map to the players that they may motify as they explore and gain new information.

### Pushing a Roll

To push a roll, a PC may gain one point of exhaustion in exchange for rerolling all dice involved. They may keep rerolling and gaining additional point of exhaustion until they have six points of exhaustion and begin making death saves, at which point the roll automatically succeeds.

### Time

When a play session ends in a safe location, it is up to the PCs how much in-game time passes before the next session. They should agree on a duration. In cases where consensus cannot be had, the average is taken.

When a play session ends with the PCs in a dangerous location, time is paused until the next session. Optionally, the PCs may decide to roll to return to safety, turning over to chance their riches and well-being. One of the PCs roll a test, adding +1 for each of the following: they have mapped the way, they have cleared the way, they are well equipped, they are unencumbered. If they succeed, they return to safety unmolested. If they fail, they still return to safety, but at great cost.
