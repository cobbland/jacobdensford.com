# House Rules

## Gaining Inspiration

Inspiration can be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, certain situations always grant inspiration. Each character gains inspiration after completing a long rest or leveling up. A character also gains inspiration when they put themselves in harm's way by following their personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws. After rolling a critical failure, a character gains inspiration that can be used on any subsequent rolls. After rolling a critical success, a character can grant one of their companions inspiration, but does not gain inspiration themselves.

## Passive Checks

All passive checks use a base of 5 instead of 10. For example, a 1st level character with a +2 WIS and who is proficient in perception would have a 7 passive perception (base 5, +2 from WIS, +2 proficiency).

## Pushing Beyond Breaking

When a roll (either a check, attack, or save) simply must succeed, a character may push themselves beyond their breaking point in order to automatically succeed. They may choose to do this either before or after they've already made the roll. But there is a cost to such success. A character who pushes themselves in such a way is broken in their relevant stat, having to make all rolls using that stat with disadvantage until they have spent a significant amount of time (days, weeks, or even years in some cases) doing specific things to recover from that debility, as outlined by the DM. The DM will tell you what must be done to recover and how long it will take before you make the decision to push yourself in such a way.

## Rest Roleplay

During short or long rests, at least one character should roleplay a scene. Think about where the characters are and what mundane tasks they might be performing during the rest. Consider what might have been weighing on the characters' minds recently. For inspiration, optionally roll on the tables below.

1d4|Who leads the scene?
:---|---
1|Bree
2|Davos
2|Ilgiem
4|Ravyn

1d6|Who joins you?
:---|---
1|No one
2-4|One other person (roll on previous table)
5-6|Everyone

1d6|What are you doing?
:---|---
1|Sitting or leaning restfully
2|Cleaning, repairing, or polishing equipment
3|Sorting or counting consumable items
4|Eating or drinking
5|Lighting the campfire or gathering firewood and kindling
6|Pacing around restlessly

1d8|What do you think or talk about?
:---|---
1|An event from your past; something from your backgrounds, character traits, ideals, flaws, or bonds
2|An experience from earlier in the campaign
3|A character you miss or haven't seen in awhile
4|A recent person you met or social situation you engaged in
5|A recent battle or challenging encounter
6|A recent journey or discovery
7|The potential repercussions of what you've done
8|What you think might happen in the future

## Skill Checks: Limits, Successes, and Failures

Skill checks are only made when the thing is possible to do and there is a risk of failure. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a 1 is always a failure and rolling a 20 is always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. For example, a roll of 20 + 2 WIS + 2 proficiency would still succeed on a DC 25 task even though the roll only adds up to 24.

Failing a role doesn't always mean failing a task. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. For example, a roll to pick a lock might fail to meet the DC of the task, but the character could still manage to pick the lock. In such a case, it may have taken so long that a roving monster stumbled upon the party in the process, introducing a new danger. Players can request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.
