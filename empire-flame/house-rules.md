# House Rules v4

## Modified Rules

### Beyond 1st Level

Rather than tracking experience points, leveling up happens after completing a number of play sessions or milestones. One session or milestone for 2nd and 3rd levels, two for 4th level, three for 5th through 10th, four for 11th through 16th, and five for 17th through 20th.

When granted an ability score improvement class feature on any level other than 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, or 19th, it must be used for improving one of the class's primary abilities or starting saving throw proficient abilities (PH, 45), or for gaining a feat. (Other abilities may be improved at the DM's discretion if they are core to the character's concept.)

*This rule modifies Beyond 1st Level (PH, 15).*

### Inspiration

Inspiration may be spent to gain advantage on an attack role, save, or ability check before or after making the initial roll.

Inspiration may be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, these situations grant inspiration more often:

- Acting out personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws, especially when such actions put characters in harm's way
- Solving problems in a unique, impressive, and clever way
- Overcoming a significant challenge

*This rule clarifies Inspiration (PH, 125).*

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

Donning and Doffing a shield only takes a bonus action.

*This rule modifies Getting Into and Out of Armor (PH, 146)*

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If you have advantage from more sources than you have disadvantage, you still have advantage. Inversely, if you have disadvantage from more sources than you have advantage, you still have disadvantage.

*This rule modifies Advantage and Disadvantage (PH, 173).*

### Proficiency Bonus

If a PC has both a skill and a tool proficiency that apply to a check, they may roll with advantage.

*This rule adds to Proficiency Bonus (PH, 173).*

### Ability Checks

Checks are only made when the task is possible to do and the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Also, if 5 plus the character's relevant modifiers (ability and proficiency bonuses) would meet or exceed the DC, the task is automatically successful without a roll. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a 1 is always a failure and rolling a 20 is always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. Failing or succeeding a roll in such a way may introduce new complications or advantages.

Failing a roll doesn't always mean failing a check. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. Players may request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.

*This rule clarifies modifies Ability Checks (PH, 174).*

### Passive Checks

Passive checks are not used. Instead, the DM will call for a roll when a check wouldn't automatically succeed or fail. In some cases, the DM may make such rolls on the player character's behalf in secret.

*This rule modifies Passive Checks (PH, 175).*

### Working Together

PCs can only help, granting a fellow PC advantage on a skill check, if they possess a relevant skill.

*This rule modifies Working Together (PH, 175).*

### Lifting and Carrying

PCs have a number of item slots equal to their Strength score. PCs carrying items that fill up to twice this many slots are encumbered, reducing their speed by ten feet. PCs carrying items that fill more are heavily encumbered, reducing their speed by twenty feet and imposing disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. PCs can never carry items that fill more than three times their Strength score in item slots.

Items that can be held in one hand use one slot. Items that require two hands to carry or wield use two slots. Small items can be bundled together into one slot. Tiny or very light items do not require a slot until they are collected in significant quantities. In general, every five pounds of equipment counts as one slot.

*This rule modifies Lifting and Carrying (PH, 176) and uses parts of Variant: Encumbrance (PH, 176).*

### Saving Throws

If an effect grants a bonus to an ability check, be it numerical or advantage, that same bonus is applied to saving throws for that ability. In addition, if an effect grants a bonus to AC, that same bonus is applied to Dexterity saving throws.

*This rule modifies Saving Throws (PH, 179).*

### Bonus Actions

Usually, any single small interaction that doesn't require a roll may be performed for free during an encounter as part of your movement and action. To do more, a bonus action may be used. A bonus action may also be used to perform any proficient skill checks.

*This rule modifies Bonus Actions (PH, 189).*

### Rolling 1 or 20

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the target may make an opportunity attack using their reaction.

If the d20 roll for a saving throw is a 1, double damage dice are rolled as a critical hit.

*These rules add to Rolling 1 or 20 (PH, 194).*

### Dropping to Zero Hit Points

When a PC is reduced to zero HP and then succeeds on three death saving throws or is revived in some other way, they gain one level of exhaustion.

*This rule adds to Dropping to Zero Hit Points (PH, 197).*

### Crafting Magic Items

Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 arcanium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 arcana check. Arcanium can be used during short or long rests to create a desired magical item whose gold value matches the arcanium spent.

*This rule modifies Crafting Magic Items (DMG, 129).*

### Identifying a Magic Item

*Use the variant rule: More Difficult Identification (DMG, 136).*

### Attunement

Characters can attune to a number of magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

*This rule modifies Attunement (DMG, 136).*

### Crafting Poisons

To craft poisons, you must possess and be proficient with a poisoner's kit. Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 toxium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 nature check. Toxium can be used during a short or long rest to create the desired poison whose gold value matches the toxium spent.

*This rule adds to Crafting and Harvesting Poisons (DMG, 258).*

## Additional Rules

### Luck Coins

Luck coins are a meta-currency that allow PCs to gain inspiration.

Luck coins are gained between sessions by completing the following tasks:

- Writing an in-character journal entry
- Writing a summery of the previous session
- Updating the oaken table
- Other tasks at the referee's discretion

Unspent luck coins expire after the following session.

### The Oaken Table

In the middle of the tavern sits an oaken table, upon which past adventurers have carved a map of the surrounding region. The PCs can carve additions into this map. They can also make a rubbing to be carried abroad. The oaken table can be a real object in the world or simply a metaphor. Either way, the dungeon master provides a map to the players that they may motify as they explore and gain new information.

### Pushing a Roll

To push a roll, a PC may gain one point of exhaustion to reroll their dice. They may keep rerolling and gaining additional points of exhaustion until they have six and begin making death saves.

They may also push at death's door, marking a failed death save in exchange for staying conscious long enough to automatically succeed at one action. They may continue to push in this way until accumulating three failed death saves, at which point they die.

### Time

When a play session ends in a safe location, it is up to the PCs how much in-game time passes before the next session. They should agree on a duration. In cases where consensus cannot be had, the average is taken.

When a play session ends with the PCs in a dangerous location, time is paused until the next session. Optionally, the PCs may decide to roll to return to safety, turning over to chance their riches and well-being. One of the PCs roll a test, adding +1 for each of the following: they have mapped the way, they have cleared the way, they are well equipped, they are unencumbered. If they succeed, they return to safety unmolested. If they fail, they still return to safety, but at great cost.
