# House Rules

## Crafting

### Crafting Magic Items

Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 arcanium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 arcana check. Arcanium can be used during short or long rests to create a desired magical item whose gold value matches the arcanium spent.

### Crafting Poisons

To craft poisons, you must possess and be proficient with a poisoner's kit. Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 toxium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 nature check. Toxium can be used during a short or long rest to create the desired poison whose gold value matches the toxium spent.

To craft custom poisons, add up the total amount of toxium for a poison you wish to craft from the table below. Poisons are assumed to be applied via injury, be resisted with a DC 5 CON save, have conditions last for 1 round, deal no damage, and deal half damage on a successful save, unless other options are selected. Further options can be requested at the DM's discretion. Such additional options will likely require challenges beyond a simple gold value to craft.

Toxium|Effect
:---|---
25|The poison is applied by being ingested
50|The poison is applied by physical contact
100|The poison is applied by inhaling
50|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 10 CON save
100|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 15 CON save
200|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 20 CON save
300|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 25 CON save
50|The poison deals 1d4 poison damage
100|The poison deals 1d6 poison damage
150|The poison deals 1d8 poison damage
200|The poison deals 1d10 poison damage
250|The poison deals 1d12 poison damage
25|The poison's effects last for 1 minute
50|The poison's effects last for 1 hour
100|The poison's effects last for 1 day
200|The poison's effects last until treated
25|The poison causes one level of exhaustion
25|The poison causes the deafened condition
50|The poison causes the poisoned condition
50|The poison causes the blinded condition
75|The poison causes the frightened condition
100|The poison causes the charmed condition
125|The poison causes the incapacitated condition
150|The poison causes the stunned condition
175|The poison causes the paralyzed condition
200|The poison causes the unconscious condition

## Equipment Packs

Rather than tracking each individual item in an equipment pack, when you need an item, haven't already used it, and it would make sense for your pack to contain it, roll a check. If the item is included in the pack by default (PH, 151) or if the item is listed in the Adventuring Gear table (PH, 150) and costs 5 gp or less, the DC is 10. If the item is included in one of the other listed packs or if the item is listed in the Adventuring Gear table and costs 25 gp or less, the DC is 15. If the item is listed in the Adventuring Gear table and costs 50 gp or less, the DC is 20. If the item is listed in the Adventuring Gear table and costs 100 gp or less, the DC is 25. For other items that make sense, consult your DM for the DC.

## Expendable Equipment

Rather than tracking each piece of expendable equipment, a consequence of rolling a natural 1 on a d20 is that you expend your last use of that piece of equipment. This rule applies to anything that is normally purchased in collections of 20 (arrows or crossbow bolts, for example), or that is intentionally purchased in a collection of 20 (20 rations or 20 diamonds as spell components, for example). If using the equipment does not usually trigger a roll, the DM may still call for one to see if you run out.

## Helping

PC's can only help, granting a fellow PC advantage on a skill check, if they possess a relevant skill.

## Inspiration

Inspiration can be spent to turn disadvantage into advantage or to reroll an attack role, save, or ability check.

Inspiration can be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, certain situations always grant inspiration:

- At the start of a session
- For cashing in a luck coin
- By acting out personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws, especially when such actions put characters in harm's way (call this out to the DM so they know what you're doing)
- After rolling a critical failure (can be used on any subsequent rolls, but not on the failed roll that just happened)
- After rolling a critical success a character can grant one of their companions inspiration, but does not gain inspiration themselves
- Gain one point of exhaustion in exchange for inspiration (characters can keep gaining inspiration and rerolling the same roll, gaining one additional point of exhaustion each time until they have six points of exhaustion and begin making death saves, at which point their roll automatically succeeds)

## Leveling Up

Rather than tracking experience points, leveling up happens after completing a number of play sessions. One session for 2nd and 3rd levels, two sessions for 4th level, three sessions for 5th through 10th, four sessions for 11th through 16th, and five sessions for 17th through 20th. (Key milestones may grant expedited leveling at the DM's discretion.)

When granted an ability score improvement class feature on any level other than 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, or 19th, it must be used for improving one of the class's primary abilities (PH, 45) or for gaining a feat. (Other abilities may be improved at the DM's discretion if they are core to the character.)

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the player characters is uncertain, the DM may roll a **luck die**--usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Some examples of when a luck die might be rolled:

- When the PCs stop to rest in a dangerous location
- When a PC fails a test
- If a PC makes a loud noise in a dungeon
- After each round of dungeon exploration and wilderness navigation
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Luck Coins

**Luck coins** are a meta-currency that allow PCs to gain inspiration.

Luck coins are gained between sessions by completing the following tasks:

- Writing an in-character journal entry
- Writing a summery of the previous session
- Updating the oaken table
- Other tasks at the referee's discretion

Unspent luck coins expire after the following session.

## Magical Items

Once held, it is obvious if an item is magical or not. An item's magical properties can only be identified through experimentation or the use of a spell.

Characters can attune to a number of magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

## The Oaken Table

In the middle of the tavern sits an oaken table, upon which past adventurers have carved a map of the surrounding region. The PCs can carve additions into this map. They can also make a rubbing to be carried abroad. The oaken table can be a real object in the world or simply a metaphor.

## Proficiency

If a PC has both a skill and a tool proficiency that apply to a check, they may roll with advantage.

## Saving Throws

If an effect grants a bonus to AC, be it numerical or advantage, that same bonus is applied to Dexterity saving throws.

## Skill and Ability Checks

Checks are only made when the task is possible to do and the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Also, if 5 plus the character's relevant modifiers (ability and proficiency bonuses) would meet or exceed the DC, the task is automatically successful without a roll. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a 1 is always a failure and rolling a 20 is always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. For example, a roll of 20 + 2 WIS + 2 proficiency would still succeed on a DC 25 task even though the roll only adds up to 24. Failing or succeeding a roll in such a way introduces new complications or advantages.

Failing a roll doesn't always mean failing a check. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. For example, a roll to pick a lock might fail to meet the DC of the task, but the character could still manage to pick the lock. In such a case, it may have taken so long that a roving monster stumbled upon the party in the process, introducing a new danger. Players can request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.

Passive checks are not used. Instead, the DM will call for a roll when a check wouldn't automatically succeed or fail. In rare cases, the DM may make such rolls on the player character's behalf in private.

## Time

When a play session ends in a safe location, it is up to the PCs how much in-game time passes before the next session. They should agree on a duration. In cases where consensus cannot be had, the average is taken.

When a play session ends with the PCs in a dangerous location, time is paused until the next session. Optionally, the PCs may decide to roll to return to safety, turning over to chance their riches and well-being. One of the PCs roll a test, adding +1 for each of the following: they have mapped the way, they have cleared the way, they are well equipped, they are unencumbered. If they succeed, they return to safety unmolested. If they fail, they still return to safety, but at great cost.
