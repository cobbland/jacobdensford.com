# House Rules

## Crafting

### Crafting Magic Items

Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 arcanium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 arcana check. Arcanium can be used during short or long rests to create a desired magical item whose gold value matches the arcanium spent.

### Crafting Poisons

To craft poisons, you must possess and be proficient with a poisoner's kit. Spend 25gp and eight hours per day to create 25 toxium. Each day's gold requirement can be replaced with a successful DC 15 nature check. Toxium can be used during a short or long rest to create the desired poison whose gold value matches the toxium spent.

To craft custom poisons, add up the total amount of toxium for a poison you wish to craft from the table below. Poisons are assumed to be applied via injury, be resisted with a DC 5 CON save, have conditions last for 1 round, deal no damage, and deal half damage on a successful save, unless other options are selected. Further options can be requested at the DM's discretion. Such additional options will likely require challenges beyond a simple gold value to craft.

Toxium|Effect
:---|---
25|The poison is applied by being ingested
50|The poison is applied by physical contact
100|The poison is applied by inhaling
50|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 10 CON save
100|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 15 CON save
200|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 20 CON save
300|Resisting the poison's effects requires a DC 25 CON save
50|The poison deals 1d4 poison damage
100|The poison deals 1d6 poison damage
150|The poison deals 1d8 poison damage
200|The poison deals 1d10 poison damage
250|The poison deals 1d12 poison damage
25|The poison's effects last for 1 minute
50|The poison's effects last for 1 hour
100|The poison's effects last for 1 day
200|The poison's effects last until treated
25|The poison causes one level of exhaustion
25|The poison causes the deafened condition
50|The poison causes the poisoned condition
50|The poison causes the blinded condition
75|The poison causes the frightened condition
100|The poison causes the charmed condition
125|The poison causes the incapacitated condition
150|The poison causes the stunned condition
175|The poison causes the paralyzed condition
200|The poison causes the unconscious condition

## Expendable Equipment

Rather than tracking each piece of expendable equipment, a consequence of rolling a natural 1 on a d20 is that you expend your last use of that piece of equipment. This rule applies to anything that is normally purchased in collections of 20 (arrows or crossbow bolts, for example), or that is intentionally purchased in a collection of 20 (20 rations or 20 diamonds as spell components, for example). If using the equipment does not usually trigger a roll, the DM may still call for one to see if you run out.

## Inspiration

Inspiration can be spent either before or after rolling to gain advantage on an attack role, save, or ability check.

Inspiration can be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, certain situations always grant inspiration:

- At the start of a session
- By acting out personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws, especially when such actions put characters in harm's way (call this out to the DM so they know what you're doing)
- After rolling a critical failure (can be used on any subsequent rolls, but not on the failed roll that just happened)
- After rolling a critical success a character can grant one of their companions inspiration, but does not gain inspiration themselves
- Gain one point of exhaustion in exchange for inspiration (characters can keep gaining inspiration and rerolling the same roll, gaining one additional point of exhaustion each time until they have six points of exhaustion and begin making death saves, at which point their roll automatically succeeds)

## Leveling Up

Rather than tracking experience points, leveling up happens after completing a number of play sessions. One session for 2nd through 4th levels, two sessions for 5th through 10th, three sessions for 11th through 16th, and four sessions for 17th through 20th.

When granted an ability score improvement class feature on any level other than 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, or 19th, it must be used for improving one of the class's multiclass abilities or for gaining a feat.

## Magical Items

Once held, it is obvious if an item is magical or not. An item's magical properties can only be identified through experimentation or the use of a spell.

Characters can attune to a number of magical items equal to their proficiency bonus.

## Saving Throws

If an effect grants you a bonus to AC, be it numerical or advantage, that same bonus is applied to Dexterity saving throws.

## Skill and Ability Checks

Checks are only made when the thing is possible to do and there is a risk of failure. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Also, if 5 plus the character's relevant modifiers (ability and proficiency bonuses) would meet or exceed the DC, the task is automatically successful without a roll. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a 1 is always a failure and rolling a 20 is always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. For example, a roll of 20 + 2 WIS + 2 proficiency would still succeed on a DC 25 task even though the roll only adds up to 24. Failing or succeeding a roll in such a way introduces new complications or advantages.

Failing a roll doesn't always mean failing a check. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. For example, a roll to pick a lock might fail to meet the DC of the task, but the character could still manage to pick the lock. In such a case, it may have taken so long that a roving monster stumbled upon the party in the process, introducing a new danger. Players can request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.

Passive checks are not used. Instead, the DM will call for a roll when a check wouldn't automatically succeed or fail.
