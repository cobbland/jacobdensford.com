# Magic Items

<h2 id="potions">Potions</h2>

### Myconid Essence

The corked vial swirls with glittering gold particles. One whiff creates one of the following effects:

1d10|Result
:---|---
1|The creature's skin turns an unusual color. Roll a d4: 1, purple with yellow splotches; 2, bright orange with tiger stripes; 3, tree-frog green with red squiggles; 4, hot pink with yellow spots. This change is permanent unless removed by a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic.
2|The creature gains the enlarge or reduce effect (50 percent chance of either) of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1 hour.
3|The creature regains 5d8 + 20 hit points.
4|Vocally, the creature can only cluck and croon like a chicken. The creature can also understand and speak to chickens. This curse lasts for 1 hour unless ended by a *remove curse* spell or similar magic.
5|The creature can understand and speak all languages for 1d4 days.
6|The creature gains the benefits of the *telepathy* spell for the next 24 hours.
7|The creature gains the benifits of the *speak with plants* spell for 8 hours.
8|The creature immediately casts the *time stop* spell, requiring no components. Constitution is the spellcasting ability for this spell.
9|The creature immediately casts the *detect thoughts* spell, requireing no components. Constitution is the spellcasting ability for this spell.
10|Magical mists pour out of the creature's eyes and ears, acting as a *fog cloud* spell for 1 hour that is centered on the creature and moves with it.

### Potion of Giant Strength

When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 21 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

### Zalabor the Multi-colored's Staff

*Staff, very rare (requires attunement)*

This staff is made of carved and polished wood with a cracked glass orb affixed to its top. The orb appears clear, but when light shines through it, it shines with a broken prismatic glow.

At dawn, the staff gains four charges. Expend one charge to cast a lesser version of chromatic orb (1d8 instead of 3d8 damage). The spell's damage increases by 1d8 with each additional charge expended, up to the wizard's highest spell slot. However, if the staff's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

### Javelin of Giant-friend

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

A javelin crafted by the giants as a gift to humans, whose lives are so short and bodies so weak. Faintly glowing runes line its blade. The giants worried humans wouldn't have time to retrieve their thrown weapons, nor strength to rend them from the bodies of their foes, so they imbued this javelin with runic magic. After being thrown, this javelin returns to its bearer's hand, dealing 1d4 damage to any in its direct path (including anyone who was already hit by the weapon).

### Nishanesti's Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

This dagger is golden in color with a gauntleted fist cast in miniature as its pommel. Three ivory snakes twist their way up the hilt to encircle the base of the razor-sharp blade.

This dagger deals 1d4 additional damage for each of the other Far Sea daggers that are within one hundred feet of it.

### Tewodros' Bloodthirsty Blade

*Weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*

This weapon, from hilt to blade-tip, is blacker than night and wreathed in dark smoke. It seems to almost consume the very light that touches it. It thirsts for blood. At first, it is but the size of a dagger, but as it drinks, it grows.

When this blade is drawn, its barer must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the blade and forced to attack and draw blood from the closest living being. Each time this blade draws blood, it gets larger, its damage increases, and its sway on its barer grows stronger. For the purposes of proficiency and attack rolls the blade is a dagger, even after growing. It strengthens as follows: 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12. Beyond that point, it needs two hands to wield and has reach, increasing in damage as follows: 2d6, 2d8, 2d10, 2d12, 3d6, 3d8, 3d10, 3d12, 4d6, etc. The blade requires a Wisdom saving throw to stop attacking and avoid being charmed. The save's DC increases by 1 for each successful attack after being drawn. After succeeding on the save, the blade's size and strength diminishes by one step per round.

### Tewodros' Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

Black smoke curls around this dagger, obscuring it from view.

As an bonus action, you can cause the dagger's smoke to bellow around you, acting as a *fog cloud* spell, heavily obscuring a 20-foot-radius sphere which is centered on you and moves with you. Dispelling the smoke requires another bonus action.

### Wendimu's Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

This dagger's black hilt is wrapped by a single ivory snake. The snakes mouth is open at the pommel, and the length of the snake is hollowed out. Shallow grooves twist and curl up the blade from the tip of the snake's tail.

When a poison is applied to this dagger through the mouth of  the snake, it runs up through the tail and into the grooves of the blade. Poisons applied to the dagger in this way, they last a full day instead of one hour.

### A Bag of Blood-Speckled Shroomlings

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This slightly soggy burlap sack contains soil from deep below, deeper even than the deepest mine. The soil contains a living colony of spotted red mushrooms. Once per day, when it is fertilized with fresh blood, roll 1d6.

1d6|Result
:---|---
1-2|A tiny shroomling will adopt the face and general shape of the blood donor to do your bidding before returning to the bag.
3-4|The shroomling will also have the blood donor's voice.
5-6|The shroomling will also have the blood donor's recent memories.

### Color Changing Robe of Preservation

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A fine robe, exquisite in every stitch. It changes to the color of whatever its wearer desires. The robe does not decay with age. Anything stored within the robe gains that same property. If the robe is ever damaged or dirtied, it is once again clean and mended by the next dawn.

### Vainglorious Boots

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

These gaudy boots shimmer like diamonds as they spew purple smoke. Once per day, you must pay these boots a complement and roll a DC 10 Charisma check. On a success, the boots are flatteredâ€”add 20 feet to your movement (walking) speed and gain advantage on Dexterity (Performance) checks and Dexterity saving throws, but also disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. On a failure, you still gain the benefits, but you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the Vainglorious Boots for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wearer will be forced to use the boot's powers to put themselves in harms way by acting in a vain or boastful manner. If the wearer takes damage, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect early on a success.
