### Javelin of Giant-friend

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

A javelin crafted by the giants as a gift to humans, whose lives are so short and bodies so weak. Faintly glowing runes line its blade. The giants worried humans wouldn't have time to retrieve their thrown weapons, nor strength to rend them from the bodies of their foes, so they imbued this javelin with runic magic. After being thrown, this javelin returns to its bearer's hand, dealing 1d4 damage to any in its direct path (including anyone who was already hit by the weapon).

### Nishanesti's Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

### Quelbea's Thorn Whip

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

A coiled length of living thorny vines.

When you attack with this weapon, it is as if you cast the *thorn whip* spell. The range is 30 feet and the damage is 1d6 piercing (increasing by 1d6 when you reach 5th, 11th, and 17th level). On a hit, you can pull a large or smaller creature up to 10 feet towards you. This weapon is magical and is a whip for attack bonus, damage bonus, and proficiency purposes.

### Tewodros' Bloodthirsty Blade

*Weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*

This weapon, from hilt to blade-tip, is blacker than night and wreathed in dark smoke. It seems to almost consume the very light that touches it. It thirsts for blood. At first, it is but the size of a dagger, but as it drinks, it grows.

When this blade is drawn, its barer must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the blade and forced to attack and draw blood from the closest living being. Each time this blade draws blood, it gets larger, its damage increases, and its sway on its barer grows stronger. For the purposes of proficiency and attack rolls the blade is a dagger, even after growing. It strengthens as follows: 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12. Beyond that point, it needs two hands to wield and has reach, increasing in damage as follows: 2d6, 2d8, 2d10, 2d12, 3d6, 3d8, 3d10, 3d12, 4d6, etc. The blade requires a Wisdom saving throw to stop attacking and avoid being charmed. The save's DC increases by 1 for each successful attack after being drawn. After succeeding on the save, the blade's size and strength diminishes by one step per round.

### Tewodros' Dagger (x2)

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

Black smoke curls around this dagger, obscuring it from view.

As an bonus action, you can cause the dagger's smoke to bellow around you, acting as a *fog cloud* spell, heavily obscuring a 20-foot-radius sphere which is centered on you and moves with you. Dispelling the smoke requires another bonus action.

### Wendimu's Dagger (x2)

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

This dagger's black hilt is wrapped by a single ivory snake. The snakes mouth is open at the pommel, and the length of the snake is hollowed out. Shallow grooves twist and curl up the blade from the tip of the snake's tail.

When a poison is applied to this dagger through the mouth of  the snake, it runs up through the tail and into the grooves of the blade. Poisons applied to the dagger in this way, they last a full day instead of one hour.

### Wendimu's Poison Blade

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

This short sword has a black hilt wrapped in an ivory snake. The snake's mouth opens at the blade's edge, and a narrow rivulet runs the length of the blade's edge.

When a poison is applied to this blade, its effects are increased. Saving throw DC's are increased by the wielder's proficiency bonus and poison does extra of its highest damage dice equal to the wielder's proficiency bonus. Poisons can be applied to the blade as a bonus action and last for two successful attacks instead of one.

<h2 id="wondrous">Wondrous Items</h2>

### Amulet of Sune

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*

This ancient, tarnished, silver amulet depicts the face of the goddess Sune. Dirt and moss fill the crevasses of the goddess's face. It glows gently with untapped power.

The barer of this amulet can call on Sune to cast *dispel good and evil*. As an action, beseech Sune to grant you power and roll a d20. The roll's DC is 20 - your proficiency bonus. Once cast, or if you roll below 10 - your proficiency bonus, the amulet dims and won't work again until the next dawn. The amulet's power can only be attempted once per creature until the next dawn. The amulet can act as a holy symbol and spellcasting focus.

### Bag of Blood-Speckled Shroomlings

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This slightly soggy burlap sack contains soil from deep below, deeper even than the deepest mine. The soil contains a living colony of spotted red mushrooms. Once per day, when it is fertilized with fresh blood, roll 1d6.

1d6|Result
:---|---
1-2|A tiny shroomling will adopt the face and general shape of the blood donor to do your bidding before returning to the bag.
3-4|The shroomling will also have the blood donor's voice.
5-6|The shroomling will also have the blood donor's recent memories.

### Basilisk Eye

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

When this glassy eye is turned towards a person or creature, they must succeed on a DC12 CON saving throw or be restrained. They then must succeed on DC12 CON saving throw or be turned to stone.

### Candles of the Deep (x4)

*Wonderous item, very rare*

These ancient candles glow with an eerie green light.

Lighting one of these candles grants everyone in their glow advantage on skill checks that use Intelligence and Wisdom. Lighting two grants temporary proficiency. Lighting three grants temporary expertise. Lighting four grants automatic success (as long as the DC of the check is 25 or less). To put out the candles requires a DC 15 INT or WIS saving throw, adding 5 to the DC for each candle lit beyond one. Failure traps you, lost in thought within the candles' glow.

### Cloak of the Mists

*Wonderous item, uncommon*

Mist bellows around this grey cloak, lightly obscuring those who wear it. When wearing this cloak, you count as one level more obscured than normal for the purpose of stealth checks. Additionally, your vision can pierce mist, seeing anything heavily obscured as lightly obscured and lightly obscured as if it wasn't obscured at all.

### Heart of the Bahir

*Wondrous item, very rare*

This fist sized blue heart beats with electricity. Though the creature from whom it was harvested is dead, the heart lives on.

When you cast a concentration spell, you may power the spell with the heart a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. When a spell is cast in this way, you do not have to maintain concertation on it. The spell lasts for its full duration unless the heart is destroyed.

When this heart is clenched in your fist, add 1d8 lightning damage to your unarmed attacks a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus.

A poison may be harvested from the blood of the heart that adds 1d8 lightning damage to a weapon's attack. When harvested, you gain a number of uses equal to your proficiency bonus.

When you gain a level and eat a bite of the heart, roll a constitution saving throw and choose an option:

- You may unlearn spells and learn new spells. The saving throw DC is equal to 8 + the total level of spells you changed.
- You may reasign your ability scores. The saving throw DC is equal to 8 + four times the number of points changed.
- You may change your subclass. The saving throw DC is equal to 8 + the number of levels gained since taking the original subclass.
- You may change your skills. The saving throw DC is equal to 8 + twice the number of skills changed.

If you fail the save, roll a d6. On a 1, roll on the indefinite madness table (DMG 260). On a 2-5, roll on the long-term madness table (DMG 260). On a 6, roll on the short-term madness table (DMG 259).

After the sixth bite or harvesting of blood, the heart is dried up and consumed.

### Vainglorious Boots

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

These gaudy boots shimmer like diamonds as they spew purple smoke. Once per day, you must pay these boots a complement and roll a DC 10 Charisma check. On a success, the boots are flattered—add 20 feet to your movement (walking) speed and gain advantage on Dexterity (Performance) checks and Dexterity saving throws, but also disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. On a failure, you still gain the benefits, but you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the Vainglorious Boots for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wearer will be forced to use the boot's powers to put themselves in harms way by acting in a vain or boastful manner. If the wearer takes damage, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect early on a success.

### Zalabor's Color Changing Robe of Preservation, +1

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

A fine robe, exquisite in every stitch. It changes to the color of whatever its wearer desires. The robe does not decay with age. Anything stored within the robe gains that same property.

### Zalabor's Pouch of Costly Components

*Wondrous item, rare*

This pouch is made of many colorful panels of silken fabric stitched together with golden thread.

When you cast a spell and reach into the pouch looking for components, roll a number of d6s equal to your highest unused spell slot. If your highest roll is a 1-2, the pouch is found to be empty and will remain so until the next day at dawn; 3-4, you find the components you need, after which the pouch will remain empty until the next day at dawn; 5-6, you find the component you need and believe there are likely more components remaining inside.

### Zalabor's Pouch of Frozen Rainbows

*Wonderour item, rare*

This pouch is made of several colors of felt. When opened multicolored light shines out.

Objects placed in this pouch pass into a pocket dimension where time stands still.

When the drawstring is removed, the pouch can be laid flat on the ground, creating an opening large enough for a person to pass through.
