### Alliance of the Five Domains

![Alliance of the Five Domains](/images/alliance.jpg)

Generations earlier, the five kingdoms of the continent ended the Great War by signing a treaty that formed the Alliance of the Five Domains and stipulated the construction of the locks system that would bind the kingdoms together, in travel and in trade. Each kingdom ruled itself independently but was prohibited from passing any laws or decrees that would inhibit free trade and travel between the domains. Once every five years, the leaders of each domain met to make decisions that would affect the whole continent.

### Bafeld

Bafeld is a small logging village in Endoran. The village is a tangle of alleys and row buildings. It is governed by a mayor, a man named Mathye, appointed by the Lord Mayor of Mistcrown. Bafeld is the home of a legendary hero, a female priest named Sane.

### Endoran

Endoran was the smallest kingdom of the Alliance of the Five Domains. The only landlocked kingdom with few exports, it was ruled by King Edric Almson from the capital city of Aelmore. Because of its lack of exports and seeming insignificance, the locks system that runs the length of the Alliance ends just as it enters the domain, forcing travel and trade to move more slowly across land. Many considered Endoran to be the least important of the five domains. Most Endoranians would have agreed, preferring a quiet life to one of continental significance.

### Fallion

### Llanaga

The coastal city of Llanaga was the capital of the Kingdom of Ellandon and the seat of King Surtur. Its grand, white quartzite structures extended from the cliffs inland. The populace got  poorer the closer one went to sea level and the bay. At least, that was the state of things before Empress Nishanesti, her siblings, and her armies arrived.

### Minaldar

Minaldar was a kingdom in the Alliance.

### Mistcrown

![Mistcrown](/images/mistcrown.png)

The sleepy town of Mistcrown sat atop a hill. The lowland fields surrounding the town were perpetually cloaked in fog. Mistcrown used to be rich and prosperous, at least by Endoranian standards. But when the stretch of the Emerald River beside which the town was built all but dried up, most of the town's wealth went with it.

### Ostoria

Ostoria was the capital city of a kingdom of giants that spanned the continent before the second cataclysm buried it far beneath the ground.

### Wafeld

Wafeld is a small logging village in Endoran. The village sits in the shadows of the ruins of a civilization long past. It is governed by a council of wealthy landowners, whose weekly meetings often turn into drunken brawls.
