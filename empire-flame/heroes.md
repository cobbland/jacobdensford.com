# Heroes

<h2 id="bree">Bree</h2>

![Bree](/images/bree.png)

*she/her, halfling, bard 4/cleric 1, criminal, played by Kelly*

**From Kelly:**

> Bree was abandoned by her mother when she was just a baby. She was left in a box in an alleyway in the eastern area of Mistcrown, just outside of the wall. Hugo, a young boy of 8 years old, found her crying and brought her to his leader, Potter Jones. They were part of a den of thieves called the Black Court. The Black Court was made up of all manners of children ranging in ages from 4-18 who were brought up to steal from the rich and prosperous in town to provide for each other. Bree grew to see these people as her family.
>
> On her 5th birthday, Potter Jones presented her with a gift. It was a simple gift, made up of hallowed out sticks, but she loved it. It was her first pan flute. Somehow, the love she gave her flute imbued it with specific magical qualities that she did not quite understand (yet).
>
> As she grew older, she never let go of the flute, practicing daily. Her thoughts however, drifted to the open world. She never grew tired of thieving for her beloved Black Court, but she wanted more.
>
> Bree is a halfling of 19 years old. She is a spunky little thing with a mass of curly hair and a deep olive complexion. She wields two daggers for close hands-on combat but mostly relies on the spells coming from her pan flute.
