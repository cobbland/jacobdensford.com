# Heroes

<h2 id="bree">Bree Heartstring</h2>

![Bree](/images/bree.png)

*she/her, halfling, criminal, bard 4/cleric 2, played by Kelly*

Abandoned at a very young age, Bree grew up on the streets of Mistcrown alone, until she was adopted into the Black Court. She had an affinity for music and learned to play several instruments in her youth. She was also adept at thieving. These two skills together made her a valuable asset to the Black Court.

Bree was always focused on what and where the closest valuable object was, and determined to figure out how she might obtain it--sometimes to her determent. She was slow to trust but fiercely loyal once she did. She valued freedom above all else, for herself and for others.

Later in life, after becoming one of the four Mistguard, she devoted herself to the goddess Mishakal and embraced her ability to heal others and her protective nature.

![Davos](/images/davos.png)

*he/him, human, sage/haunted one, wizard 6, played by Jordan*

Even Davos was not sure how long he'd been alive. He was an important figure hundreds of years before, during the great war. It was then that he made his greatest blunder--a mistake he hid from for centuries, seeking solace in the bottom of bottle after bottle.

Davos would go to great lengths to avoid talking about the past that haunted him and the guilt that threatened to consume him. He sought knowledge above all else and believed it was the main path to self-improvement. As such, he never could avoid getting swept up in a compelling mystery. He had lost faith in humanity and preferred the company of animals.
