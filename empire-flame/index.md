*The Kingdom of Endoran is on the brink of war. In the capital of Aelmore, King Edric Almson calls for all able-bodied men and women of fighting age to muster to the city's defense.*

*A power from the Far Sea Archipelago has landed on the shores of the continent. Its eyeless, earless, tongueless armies sweep across the Alliance of the Five Domains. Few can resist. Most have already fallen. Already Empress Nishanesti of the Far Sea has fixed her seat of power in the White Seclusium of the port city of Llanaga in the southern-most kingdom of Ellandon, alongside her siblings, Tewodros and Wendimu.*

*The third moon grows closer by the day.*

*The earth quakes.*

*Each dawn arrives redder than the last, like flames on the horizon.*

*But in the Endoranian town of Mistcrown, much is the same as it has always been. The mists still cloak the lowland fields from dusk until noon, the temple bells still ring to mark the hour, and the Clouded Cauldron still serves the best ale in the East District. Life isn't as easy as it used to be before the stretch of the Emerald River beside which the town was built all but dried up. Yet even though crime is on the rise, there's still honest work to be had for those who seek it.*

*Invasions and wars are problems for the Alliance to worry about. Not regular folk. But there are four in Mistcrown who are anything but normal. They are touched by destiny. Willingly or not, they must face the greatest challenge the world has ever known.*

*They must defeat empires.*

*They must conquer flames.*

### Prologue

*Everyone knows the Clouded Cauldron has the best ale in Mistcrown, if not all of Endoran. Even those just passing through town quickly hear of the tavern's reputation for fine drink. Though one must navigate through the East District and cross the Black Bridge to reach it, all who visit agree it is worth the trip.*

*The proprietor of the Clouded Cauldron is a stern older woman named Hilde. She has long gray hair tied back in a braid that swishes back and forth as she strides competently from table to table, making sure to great each new arrival with the offer of ale and a room for the night.*

*Tonight, the Clouded Cauldron is especially busy. Soldiers sent forth from Aelmore to gather recruits from across Endoran have stopped through town on their way back to the capital, undisciplined new recruits in tow.*

*You find yourself sat at a crowded table near the back of the tavern, uncomfortably far from the hearth and the bar. Still, your mug never runs dry and you have your fill of mistfield pheasant pie. Things could be worse.*

**Ellanday, the 30th day of Growing, in the 371st year of the Alliance**

The Four first met at the Clouded Cauldron. Little is known about this first meeting, other than the fact that none of them seemed to care for each other. It wasn't friendship that first brought The Four together. For one, it was curiosity and the desire for ale. For another, it was nothing more than a gut feeling. For a third, it was duty and honor. For the last, it was the promise of treasure.

### Chapter 1: Dungeons & Dragons

*A jagged field of ash stretches into the distance.*

*Three blood red moons hang heavily in the twilight sky, drifting ever closer to the crimson horizon.*

*Before you, a lone figure draped in shadow sits atop a black stallion wreathed in flame.*

*The wind blows hot and dry. It chaps the skin of your already cracked and bleeding face. You've been here before. Or perhaps you never left. Is this home? Or is it hell? Is there even a difference?*

*The earth quakes. Your mount whinnies and tosses his head impatiently beneath you, drawing the attention of the other mounted figure. He turns towards you. In the carmine glow, he reveals his sinister smile.*

*Someone approaches from behind. Turning, you see two more mounted figures arrive. Are these three friend or foe? Before you can decide, one rides right up beside you. The figure reaches towards you, boney hand protruding from beneath a black cloak.*

*A single finger grazes your cheek, sending an icy shock down your spine.*

*You feel yourself yanked free from your body, your spirit hurled into the air. You fly higher and higher.*

*Looking down, you see the four figures riding abreast towards the setting moons. In their wake, the ash churns and births forth flame and abomination onto the land.*

*You can no longer bare to watch.*

*You look away*

*And then all is cast in darkness.*

**Yonday, the 31st day of Growing, in the 371st year of the Alliance**

The Four each sought Balasar the wizard for different reasons. They didn't know it at the time, but it was design more than chance that brought them together that day, where they met outside the wizard's tower.

The wizard's tower was one of the tallest buildings in Mistcrown. At only four stories high, that wasn't saying much. It had been finely constructed by local artisans at Balasar's specific directions, with hammered bronze details and several ornate stained glass windows. Though Balasar was friendly and often maked appearances at local functions, few had ever entered his tower, which surely contained many closely guarded secrets.

Davos was a washed up wizard. Once he had been one of the greatest of his order. But now, he was haunted by his past. He didn't recall at the time why he was so upset with the other wizard Balasar, but he knew that he was, so he stood shouting up at his tower. He had been passing through Mistcrown for no particular reason other than the fact that the last town he was in had thrown him out, and Mistcrown was the next town down the road.

Bree, having heard Davos was planning on visiting the wizard, and hoping she could steal some valuable items from the wizard's tower, lurked nearby in the shadows. She had always hoped a score this big would come her way, but didn't think she would get the opportunity in a town as humble as Mistcrown.

Ravyn was cursed to live as an tiefling, though she did her best to hide it. She was in Mistcrown because her instincts told her she should be here. She had always followed her gut. It had served her well as a criminal and a thief. And, though she had left that life behind her, she still trusted her instincts. Once she'd seen the wizard's tower, she knew she had to get in and speak to the wizard. Though she didn't know why, her instincts told her it was important.

Ilgiem was blessed to live life as an aasimar. Though at times he felt unworthy of that blessing, especially after the debacle that had ended his military career and cost many lives, he did his best not to show it, which made him seem proud and boastful to most. He was in Mistcrown because Ravyn was. The two were inseparable, even if sometimes they could hardly stand each other.

Fed up with waiting for Balasar to answer his door, Davos took matters into his own hands. A spell or two later and he was storming inside, followed closely by Bree. Ravyn and Ilgiem, seeing it as their opportunity to get to the wizard, followed behind. But once inside, a trap was sprung. The doors through the vestibules shut and sealed, and the chamber began to fill with water.

Davos passed out and had an unsettling vision, which has been transcribed at the beginning of this chapter. Ilgiem revived him before he drowned facedown in the rising water.

Ravyn managed to find the release valves for the water before the room finished filling, and Ilgiem and Bree turned them. Unfortunately, none of them notice the electrical trap embedded in the handles, so they all got quite a shock. Still, they managed to disable the water trap and enter the tower.

Once inside, they found a note addressed to Davos, telling him of Balasar's suspicion that the quakes and the Emerald River's disappearance were related, and of his discovery that Mistcrown had been built atop an ancient barrow. He requested Davos meet him down within the barrow. So Davos went, still intending to give the other wizard a piece of his mind. The others followed.

The air was still and stale down within the barrow, having been left undisturbed for centuries at least. The walls and ceilings were made of uncut, stacked stone. Candles lined the passage, long since burnt to nubs, their wax having dripped down the rough walls and hardened into stalactites. Alcoves were piled with stacks of bones. Skulls stared up at the four with unseeing eye sockets. Beyond the light from the crack in Balasar's cellar, the barrow was cloaked in complete darkness.

Davos cast a spell and his staff burst with illumination, lighting his way. Though he and Bree searched, they failed to find the obvious directions Balasar had left for Davos to follow. Instead, the followed a different trail

The scraping footprints led them twisting and turning through the barrow until they entered a room. A dead end. That was when the owners of the prints attacked. Reanimated skeletons wielding ancient blades rushed them. But The Four were no commoners. They easily dispatched the foes with a few well placed spells and swings of their blades.

Backtracking, they caught sight of a new set of footprints. These ones were definitely left by booted feet. Surely, they thought, they were on the right track.

They were not.

The booted prints led them once again twisting and turning through the barrow. And, once again, they entered a dead end room. Though this one was larger and more ornate than the one before. It was held aloft by stacked pillars. At its head was a raised platform and a sarcophagus. Upon entering the room, the lid of the sarcophagus slid free, and a large skeleton draped in a fine robe and wearing ornate boots, stepped out. Two more skeletons materialized from the shadows behind the first.

This encounter proved to be more challenging for The Four. Davos cast a spell. Eshanti charged in, warhammer raised above her head, and smashed the sarcophagus to pieces--the large skeleton would never again find rest, whether or not The Four found victory that day. Ravyn leaped through the air with her daggers. And Ilgiam brought his halberd to bare. They emerged victorious.

The Four took a well deserved rest, mending their wounds and investigating the nature of the fine robe and ornate boots. Ravyn stepped into the boots, which spewed purple smoke from within. Once donned, the Vainglorious Boots sang in her mind, requesting compliments and the promise of glory, which Ravyn provided. Davos picked up the robe. Instantly, it changed to black, which was the color he had been thinking of. He found that any color he imagined while holding the robe caused it to respond in kind. The robe also mended itself, and showed itself to have preservative properties. It was the Color Changing Robe of Preservation.

Searching around the room, Ilgiam located a hidden lever within the rubble of the sarcophagus. He pulled the lever to reveal a secret passage. The passage lead to winding stair, which Davos promptly tumbled down. The rest of The Four followed, deeper and deeper into the barrow. As they delved, The Four noticed small tunnels burrowed into the walls of the passage. They were covered in scratch marks and looked much newer than the burrows themselves.

Ahead, there was a crack in the wall, much like the crack they had entered through in Balasar's cellar. A rat appeared in the crack. At first, it seemed to be a normal rat. But after an investigation by Davos and some divine magic by Ilgiam, it was determined that it was no ordinary rat. It was a fell beast. And evil creature. Having been made, it scurried away.

The Four entered through the crack and found themselves in a smooth, natural cave tunnel, almost tall enough to stand in. Lower and narrower newly carved passages lead off to the sides. Sputtering torches were affixed to the walls at seemingly random intervals, casting most of the tunnel in dim light.

Surely Balasar had come this way.

The Four traveled through the cavern, easily finding Balasar's trail. But it wasn't long before Bree was tempted away from the group by the sighting of a gold coin at the entrance of a small side passage. She squeezed her way through the passage, finding coin after coin, until the tunnel opened up into a chamber. Within, three barrels of cold and jewels sat. Atop the hoard sat three diabolical golden bars, surely cursed.

Before Bree could make the mistake of taking some of the treasure, Davos squeezed his way through the passage and tried to stop her. But the little thief could not be swayed. She touched the gold and became cursed. She drove into one of the barrels of gold, surrounding herself jealously with riches she was would never truly posses. Davos recognized the curse for what it was and knew if he could only get Bree far enough away from the treasure she would recover. He cast a sleeping spell upon her and pulled her out of the chamber and back to the others. Where it not for Davos's intervention, she would have surely perished.

Back on track, the Four followed Balasar's trail until it reached a fork in the tunnel, passing (and killing) several frozen solid kobolds on the way. Three passages. Balasar had clearly taken the first, but to the right, desperate sounds of a captive could be heard. They considered continuing on, for their quest was feeling more and more urgent. But each of them was good at heart, despite what outward appearances might suggest.

### Chapter 2: In the Halls of the Black Court

*You stand alone atop a tower that affords a wide view of the distant obsidian mountains, their tops blown open, lava flowing freely down their sides.*

*You stand alone atop a tower, heavily booted feet planted on hard stone, gauntleted hands resting on the parapet.*

*You stand alone atop a tower, looking down at your gathered army. Vile, defiled, unspeakable creatures assembled at your command. Their numbers are so great that they stretch from the base of your tower into the horizon.*

*Yes. Your tower. Of course it is your tower. Why shouldn't it be? Why shouldn't all of this be yours? The assembled army and all the land, from horizon to horizon.*

*Several pairs of footsteps on the winding stair tell you you are no longer alone. Turning, you see three darkly cloaked figures joining you. They smile gleefully. They smile wickedly. Are these three friend or foe? You decide it doesn't matter, as long as you can use them for your own ends.*

*One steps forward from the rest, reaching a finger towards you that is barely more than bone. The finger touches your forehead and fills you with an icy chill. Suddenly, you are ripped free from your body, your spirit hurled into the air. You fly higher and higher, faster and faster.*

*Looking down, you see four figures atop a tower, gazing out over a field of unspeakable creatures that stretches from horizon to horizon.

*You can no longer bare to look.*

*You squeeze your eyes shut.*

*And then all is cast in darkness.*

**Ellanday, the 35th day of Growing, in the 371st year of the Alliance**

It had been four days since the Four had been teleported back to the wizard's tower. Four days since, at Balasar's urging, requesting an audience with the Lord Mayor of Mistcrown.

### Chapter 3: In the Footsteps of Giants

*You sit atop a throne of obsidian. Nails affixed into the seat and back press into your bony flesh.*

*A grand hall stretches around you. Black stone. Black pillars. A wicked fresco painted on the domed ceiling.*

*Statues line the walls, idols of all those who came before, all those who failed.*

*You are not like them. You will not fail.*

*A trembling man kneels before you. He is robed in red, with a red circle painted on his forehead. Lines of sweat drip from his brow, carrying streaks of paint down his face. A pathetic worm. A craven fool. But a necessary servant.*

*He has just finished recounting his failure, though you find that you can't remember what he had said. It is as if you only just arrived, yet you know you've been sitting here for hours. You can tell by the dull ache of the nails piercing your back and thighs.*

*A thought forms unbidden in your mind.*

*It is not yet time, my chosen one.*

*Your hand reaches up towards your face, beyond your control. Your finger presses against your forehead, sending a cold shock down your spine.*

*You are hurled free from your body, launched up into the air. You pass through the domed ceiling and out into the infinite night.*

*Looking down, you see a grand and horrible castle surrounded by a mote of lava. Beyond that, a cursed city, fields of putrid grain, a landscape of dread and despair inhabited by the internally damned.*

*You can't bare to look any longer.*

*You squeeze your eyes shut.*

*And then all is cloaked in darkness.*

**Ellanday, the 1st day of Reaping, in the 371st year of the Alliance**

### Chapter 4: City of Giants

*Dark walls press in around you, dripping with the blood of all those whose secrets you have pried free.*

*Chains, spikes, and other unspeakable implements of torture decorate the room. Your tools. Your instruments.*

*A man stands defiantly before you; eyeless, earless, and tongueless. Even in his sin, even after hours of pain, he refuses to kneel.*

*Still, you feel yourself smile. You finally have one of them. Long have you waited. You knew it was only a matter of time. Even she cannot keep them all sinless forever.*

*Though the man cannot speak, you can hear his thoughts. And he directs them at you.*

*"One of them is with you now, aren't they?" He asks with a sneer. You can tell he already knows the answer.*

*He is right, of course. You are of two minds. You must banish the other before you begin your symphony. You wouldn't want them learning too much before the time is right.*

*Whose thoughts are these inside your head? Not yours. You share this body with someone else. This other someone lifts your hand and presses your finger against your forehead, sending a cold chill down your spine. For a moment, you fight it. But this other is too powerful. You are ripped free from your body and hurled into the air.*

*You pass through blood and stone. Through chamber after chamber.*

*You hear the millions of screams of all those who dwell in this foul dungeon.*

*You see their wailing faces as you ascend.*

*You bare it for as long as you can.*

*Then all is darkness.*

**Endday, the 5th day of Reaping, in the 371st year of the Alliance**

### Chapter 5 & 7: Aelmore has Fallen & Last Stand of the Alliance

*Aelmore has fallen.*

*After the southern kingdoms of Ellandon, Fallion, and Minaldar gave way to the sinless army, Nishanesti set her sights to the north. Her armies marched against Endoran and the capital city of Aelmore. Though they fought valiantly, her might proved too great for King Edric Almson and his troops to resist. They were forced to retreat up the Emerald Road.*

*Now, only Mistcrown stands between Nishanesti and the northernmost kingdom of Yondar. However, since Yondar is peaceful and sparsely populated, her success there would be almost assured. And so the fight for the Alliance of the Five Domains will be decided on the mistfields.*

*Will King Edric Almson and his army prove victorious? Or will Nishanesti defeat them and rule all? The fate of the continent will be decided in the coming days. It may very well rest in the hands of The Four.*

*Will they defeat empires?*

*Will they conquer flames?*

*Bree was abandoned by her mother when she was just a baby. She was left in a box in an alleyway in the eastern area of Mistcrown, just outside of the wall. Hugo, a young boy of 8 years old, found her crying and brought her to his leader, Potter Jones. They were part of a den of thieves called the Black Court. The Black Court was made up of all manners of children ranging in ages from 4-18 who were brought up to steal from the rich and prosperous in town to provide for each other. Bree grew to see these people as her family.*

*On her 5th birthday, Potter Jones presented her with a gift. It was a simple gift, made up of hallowed out sticks, but she loved it. It was her first pan flute. Somehow, the love she gave her flute imbued it with specific magical qualities that she did not quite understand (yet).*

### Aelmore

The city of Aelmore was the capital of the Kingdom of Endoran and the seat of King Edric Almson. Though it was situated far from any waterway, all trade coming to or from Endoran passed through the city before continuing on.

### Alliance of the Five Domains

Generations earlier, the five kingdoms of the continent ended the Great War by signing a treaty that formed the Alliance of the Five Domains and stipulated the construction of the locks system that would bind the kingdoms together, in travel and in trade. Each kingdom ruled itself independently but was prohibited from passing any laws or decrees that would inhibit free trade and travel between the domains. Once every five years, the leaders of each domain met to make decisions that would affect the whole continent.

### Bafeld

Bafeld is a small logging village in Endoran. The village is a tangle of alleys and row buildings. It is governed by a mayor, a man named Mathye, appointed by the Lord Mayor of Mistcrown. Bafeld is the home of a legendary hero, a female priest named Sane.

### Ellandon

The Kingdom of Ellandon was the richest kingdom in the Alliance of the Five Domains. It was the first kingdom to fall to Empress Nishanesti and her armies.

### Endoran

Endoran was the smallest kingdom of the Alliance of the Five Domains. The only landlocked kingdom with few exports, it was ruled by King Edric Almson from the capital city of Aelmore. Because of its lack of exports and seeming insignificance, the locks system that runs the length of the Alliance ends just as it enters the domain, forcing travel and trade to move more slowly across land. Many considered Endoran to be the least important of the five domains. Most Endoranians would have agreed, preferring a quiet life to one of continental significance.

### Fallion

Fallion was a kingdom in the Alliance.

### Far Sea

The Far Sea was the body of water to the east of the continent, beyond which was the Far Sea Archipelago.

### Far Sea Archipelago

Little was known about the Far Sea Archipelago, other than that it was where Empress Nishanesti, her siblings, and her armies came from.

### Llanaga

The coastal city of Llanaga was the capital of the Kingdom of Ellandon and the seat of King Surtur. Its grand, white quartzite structures extended from the cliffs inland. The populace got  poorer the closer one went to sea level and the bay. At least, that was the state of things before Empress Nishanesti, her siblings, and her armies arrived.

### Minaldar

Minaldar was a kingdom in the Alliance.

### Mistcrown

The sleepy town of Mistcrown sat atop a hill. The lowland fields surrounding the town were perpetually cloaked in fog. Mistcrown used to be rich and prosperous, at least by Endoranian standards. But when the stretch of the Emerald River beside which the town was built all but dried up, most of the town's wealth went with it.

### Wafeld

Wafeld is a small logging village in Endoran. The village sits in the shadows of the ruins of a civilization long past. It is governed by a council of wealthy landowners, whose weekly meetings often turn into drunken brawls.

### Yondar

Yondar was the northern most kingdom in the Alliance.

<h2 id="organizations">Appendix 3: Organizations</h2>

<h2 id="magic-items">Appendix 5: Magical Items</h2>

### Potions

#### Potion of Giant Strength

When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 21 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

### Staffs

#### Zalabor the Multi-colored's Staff

*Staff, rare (requires attunement)*

This staff is made of carved and polished wood with a cracked glass orb affixed to its top. The orb appears clear, but when light shines through it, it shines with a broken prismatic glow.

At dawn, the staff gains four charges. Expend one charge to cast a lesser version of chromatic orb (1d8 instead of 3d8 damage). The spell's damage increases by 1d8 with each additional charge expended, up to the wizard's highest spell slot. However, if the staff's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

### Weapons

#### Daggers of the Far Sea

Three daggers rest on a bed of padded silk within a polished wooden box. They are the Daggers of the Far Sea, given as gifts from Empress Nishanesti to her most sinless generals. Each of the three daggers represents on of the three imperial siblings.

##### Nishanesti's Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

This dagger is golden in color with a gauntleted fist cast in miniature as its pommel. Three ivory snakes twist their way up the hilt to encircle the base of the razor-sharp blade.

This dagger deals 1d4 additional damage for each of the other Far Sea daggers that are within one hundred feet of it.

##### Wendimu's Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

This dagger's black hilt is wrapped by a single ivory snake. The snakes mouth is open at the pommel, and the length of the snake is hollowed out. Shallow grooves twist and curl up the blade from the tip of the snake's tail.

When a poison is applied to this dagger through the mouth of  the snake, it runs up through the tail and into the grooves of the blade. Poisons applied to the dagger in this way, they last a full day instead of one hour.

##### Tewodros's Dagger

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

Black smoke curls around this dagger, obscuring it from view.

As an action, you can cause the dagger's smoke to bellow around you, heavily obscuring a 20-foot-radius sphere, which disperses after 1 hour or if blown by a wind of moderate or greater speed.

#### Javelin of Giant-friend

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*

A javelin crafted by the giants as a gift to humans, whose lives are so short and bodies so weak. Faintly glowing runes line its blade. The giants worried humans wouldn't have time to retrieve their thrown weapons, nor strength to rend them from the bodies of their foes, so they imbued this javelin with runic magic. After being thrown, this javelin returns to its bearer's hand, dealing 1d4 damage to any in its direct path (including anyone who was already hit by the weapon).

### Wondrous Items

#### A Bag of Blood-Speckled Shroomlings

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This slightly soggy burlap sack contains soil from deep below, deeper even than the deepest mine. The soil contains a living colony of spotted red mushrooms. Once per day, when it is fertilized with fresh blood, roll 1d6.

1d6|Result
:---|---
1-2|A tiny shroomling will adopt the face and general shape of the blood donor to do your bidding before returning to the bag.
3-4|The shroomling will also have the blood donor's voice.
5-6|The shroomling will also have the blood donor's recent memories.

#### Color Changing Robe of Preservation

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A fine robe, exquisite in every stitch. It changes to the color of whatever its wearer desires. The robe does not decay with age. Anything stored within the robe gains that same property. If the robe is ever damaged or dirtied, it is once again clean and mended by the next dawn.

#### Vainglorious Boots

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

These gaudy boots shimmer like diamonds as they spew purple smoke. Once per day, you must pay these boots a complement and roll a DC 10 Charisma check. On a success, the boots are flattered—add 20 feet to your movement (walking) speed and gain advantage on Dexterity (Performance) checks and Dexterity saving throws, but also disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. On a failure, you still gain the benefits, but you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the Vainglorious Boots for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wearer will be forced to use the boot's powers to put themselves in harms way by acting in a vain or boastful manner. If the wearer takes damage, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect early on a success.

### Gaining Inspiration

Inspiration can be handed out at any time at the DM's discretion. However, certain situations always grant inspiration. Each character gains inspiration after completing a long rest or leveling up. A character also gains inspiration when they put themselves in harm's way by following their personality traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws. After rolling a critical failure, a character gains inspiration that can be used on any subsequent rolls. After rolling a critical success, a character can grant one of their companions inspiration, but does not gain inspiration themselves.

### Passive Checks

All passive checks use a base of 5 instead of 10. For example, a 1st level character with a +2 WIS and who is proficient in perception would have a 7 passive perception (base 5, +2 from WIS, +2 proficiency).

### Pushing Beyond Breaking

When a roll (either a check, attack, or save) simply must succeed, a character may push themselves beyond their breaking point in order to automatically succeed. They may choose to do this either before or after they've already made the roll. But there is a cost to such success. A character who pushes themselves in such a way is broken in their relevant stat, having to make all rolls using that stat with disadvantage until they have spent a significant amount of time (days, weeks, or even years in some cases) doing specific things to recover from that debility, as outlined by the DM. The DM will tell you what must be done to recover and how long it will take before you make the decision to push yourself in such a way.

### Rest Roleplay

During short or long rests, at least one character should roleplay a scene. Think about where the characters are and what mundane tasks they might be performing during the rest. Consider what might have been weighing on the characters' minds recently. For inspiration, optionally roll on the tables below.

1d4|Who leads the scene?
:---|---
1|Bree
2|Davos
2|Ilgiem
4|Ravyn

1d6|Who joins you?
:---|---
1|No one
2-4|One other person (roll on previous table)
5-6|Everyone

1d6|What are you doing?
:---|---
1|Sitting or leaning restfully
2|Cleaning, repairing, or polishing equipment
3|Sorting or counting consumable items
4|Eating or drinking
5|Lighting the campfire or gathering firewood and kindling
6|Pacing around restlessly

1d8|What do you think or talk about?
:---|---
1|An event from your past; something from your backgrounds, character traits, ideals, flaws, or bonds
2|An experience from earlier in the campaign
3|A character you miss or haven't seen in awhile
4|A recent person you met or social situation you engaged in
5|A recent battle or challenging encounter
6|A recent journey or discovery
7|The potential repercussions of what you've done
8|What you think might happen in the future

### Skill Checks: Limits, Successes, and Failures

Skill checks are only made when the thing is possible to do and there is a risk of failure. If something would have a DC of 5 or lower, no check is needed. The character can simply accomplish the task. Conversely, if something would have a DC higher than 30, no check is made. The task is impossible for the character to accomplish.

Rolling a 1 is always a failure and rolling a 20 is always a success, even if the modified roll would not have failed or succeeded numerically when compared to the DC of the task. For example, a roll of 20 + 2 WIS + 2 proficiency would still succeed on a DC 25 task even though the roll only adds up to 24.

Failing a role doesn't always mean failing a task. At the DM's discretion, a failed roll can still accomplish a given task, provided some other complication or danger is introduced. For example, a roll to pick a lock might fail to meet the DC of the task, but the character could still manage to pick the lock. In such a case, it may have taken so long that a roving monster stumbled upon the party in the process, introducing a new danger. Players can request this compromise from the DM after a failed role, but the DM is under no obligation to offer it.
