## Hook

*As you exit the hidden passage that leads out from within Zalabor's dungeons, your hand brushes against the gem of creation, granting you a vision of one of an infinate number of futures. After a brief moment of disorientation, you stand back out on the Yondar Steppes. The tower rumbles behind you. A woman runs towards you from the west. Dark clouds fill the sky. Lightning strikes and the land shakes with the crash of thunder.*
