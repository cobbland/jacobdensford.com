![A rough character sheet design with some dice sitting on it.](/images/newtrpg.jpg)

Here are the rules for a new tabletop roleplaying game I'm working on. They're incomplete and very much a work-in-progress, obviously. They're also incredibly generic right now. Eventually, once I settle on a setting, theme, and tone, I will rework some of the mechanics and the classes to more closely reflect those decisions. I'd call this a version 0.0.1.

> *Throughout this document, design notes will be denoted by block quotes.*

> **Design Requirements:**
>
> - Use all the dice
> - No math
> - Options for players doing all the rolling or players and GMs both rolling
> - OSR (Old-School Renaissance/Revival) compatible-ish
> - NSR (New OSR or New Sworddream Renaissance) sensibilities, to an extent
> - Be simple enough to easily learn and run a one-shot but complex enough for campaign play and to offer extra depth for players who want it
> - Have mechanics that reinforce the themes and tones of the game and offer options for emergent storytelling

## Making Player Characters

Follow these steps to create a player character (or PC for short).

### NAME is a STYLE CLASS who MOTIVATION, but FLAW.

A player character starts with a name, a style, a motivation, and a flaw. (A class will be chosen later.)

Roll or choose a name, style, motivation, and flaw from the lists below or write your own that matches the format. (Feel free to slightly alter the format to make everything flow nicely.)

d12|Name
:--|---
1|Bob
2|Jane
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc
7|Etc
8|Etc
9|Etc
10|Etc
11|Etc
12|Etc

d12|Style
:--|---
1|charming
2|rugged
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc
7|Etc
8|Etc
9|Etc
10|Etc
11|Etc
12|Etc

d12|Motivation
:--|---
1|seeks wealth to pay their family's debts
2|strives for perfection in function and form
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc
7|Etc
8|Etc
9|Etc
10|Etc
11|Etc
12|Etc

d12|Flaw
:--|---
1|can't resist stealing everything valuable not nailed down
2|will never trust again after what happened last time
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc
7|Etc
8|Etc
9|Etc
10|Etc
11|Etc
12|Etc

**Example character:** *Jane is a charming CLASS who seeks wealth to pay her family's debts, but she will never trust again after what happened last time.*

> Flaw might be replaced with Worst Outcome.

### Attributes

There are three attributes: Body (BOD), Intellect (INT), and Willpower (WIL). A PC's Body represents how strong and dexterous they are, Intellect how sharp-eyed and smart, and Willpower their force of will and magical potential.

Roll on the following table for each attribute to assign dice.

d8|Attribute Die
:--|---
1-4|d4
5-6|d6
7-8|d8

Alternatively, assign a d6 to each attribute (or a d6 to one, a d8 to one, and a d4 to one).

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gets a d6 in BOD, a d8 in INT, and a d4 in WIL.*

### Classes

There are three main classes. They are Warrior, Thief, and Mage. Each specializes in one of the three attributes. The Warrior's focus is Body, the Thief's Intellect, and the Mage's Willpower.

Each class grants the PC certain special abilities.

Based on your attributes, choose one of the three main classes. Then choose one of that classes starting abilities.

**Example character:** *Jane takes the Thief class, since her best attribute is INT.*

> There might be six additional classes that focus on combinations of the three attributes.

> Class abilities shouldn't negate something creative that everyone should be able to do. Instead, they should grant specific thematic mechanics for doing something cool, or grant new abilities that a regular person wouldn't be able to do. For example, a thief might be tricky so they have an ability that lets them "cheat" on a roll, or a warrior might have more grit so they can take hits on their STR HP track to push a miss into a hit. Or something like that. Flavorful, thematic, mechanics. Classes probably also have special tracks and/or clocks.

### Skills

There are twelve skills. Each is associated with one of the three attributes (but can be used with a different attribute if and when it makes sense).

**BOD Skills:**

- Close Quarters Combat
- Etc
- Etc
- Etc


**INT Skills:**

- Investigation
- Ranged Combat
- Etc
- Etc

**WIL Skills:**

- Persuasion
- Leadership
- Etc
- Etc

Assign a d6 to three skills (or a d6 to one, a d8 to one, and a d4 to one).

### Equipment

Roll or choose an equipment package from your class.

1d6|Warrior Equipment
:--|---
1|Etc
2|Etc
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc

1d6|Thief Equipment
:--|---
1|Etc
2|Etc
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc

1d6|Mage Equipment
:--|---
1|Etc
2|Etc
3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc

Then roll or choose one of these hundred trinkets.

1d100|Trinkets
:--|---
1|Etc

> Equipment doesn't add dice to rolls but it sometimes can modify roll results. It can also have rolls of its own, such as for damage from a weapon or damage reduction from a shield.

## Playing the Game

### Tests

Whenever a PC attempts to do something and the outcome is uncertain, they roll a test. First, they collect dice, one or two--one from their relevant attribute and one, if any, from a relevant skill. Then they roll, counting each die's roll individually.

Roll|Result
:--|---
1-3|Miss
4-6|Hit-
7-9|Hit
10-12|Hit+

Usually, if they rolled at least one hit (hit-, hit, or hit+), the test passes. (Rarely, especially difficult tasks might require two hits.)

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. If any of the dice are a hit-, there are unforeseen consequences. If any of the dice are a hit+, there is an unanticipated benefit. The more dice that result in a hit- or hit+, the more extreme the positive or negative extra result. (A result of a hit- and a hit+ cancel out any extra effects.)

> In general, needing more than one hit really under-powers the PCs and kind of breaks the probabilities I'm aiming for with the game, so such requirements should be used with care.

#### Help or Hinder

If another PC has a relevant skill, they may roll it (only the skill--not an associated attribute) and use a hit to either help or hinder the acted upon test--replace a miss with a hit or a hit with a miss. A hit+ or hit- on the help or hinder roll causes the unintended side effect to happens to the player helping or hindering, and a miss presents its own consequences.

#### Contested Tests (or ConTests--ha, ha, ha--get it?!)

When two PCs or a PC and an NPC are acting against each other, they collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. (In a tie, hit+ beats hit beats hit-.)

### Health Points, Death, and Healing

Each attribute has its own health point (or HP) track that is the length of the die for that attribute, and each has an associated rollable table, with better results the higher you go, from reducing the associated attribute by one or more to erasing all HP in the track. When a track is filled, roll the associated attribute die and consult the relevant table to see what happens. When any attribute is reduced beyond a d4, the PC dies.

#### BOD HP Table

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Reduce attribute die
2-3|Etc
4-6|Etc
7-8|Etc
9-10|Etc
11-12|Etc
13-16|Etc
17-19|Etc
20|Heal all HP

#### INT HP Table

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Reduce attribute die
2-3|Etc
4-6|Etc
7-8|Etc
9-10|Etc
11-12|Etc
13-16|Etc
17-19|Etc
20|Heal all HP

#### WIS HP Table

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Reduce attribute die
2-3|Etc
4-6|Etc
7-8|Etc
9-10|Etc
11-12|Etc
13-16|Etc
17-19|Etc
20|Heal all HP

HP tracks can be healed relatively easily. Whenever players take some downtime, they can roll their attribute die and regain that many hit points, up to their maximum. Returning a reduced attribute die to normal is a more involved process, requiring special care, training, or magic.

### Experience Points

PCs gain experience points (or XP) whenever they play up their style, follow their motivation, or allow their flaw to put them in a tight spot. (Players should call out these moments.) Additionally, the game master (or GM) will stipulate any other specific situations or actions that will award XP.

PC's add their earned XP to their XP track. At each die number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20), they roll (or choose options) from the XP table. The further down the track, the better the options, from gaining new skills and class abilities to increasing the die of a skill or attribute. (Skill and Attribute dice start at d4 and go up to d12.)

#### XP Table

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Nothing
2-3|Gain a new d4 skill
4-6|Increase a skill's die
7-8|Etc
9-10|Gain a new class feature
11-12|Etc
13-16|Gain a feature from a different class
17-19|Increase an attribute's die
20|Etc

## Game Master

The Game Master (or GM) facilitates the game, controlling the world and any non-player characters (or NPCs).

### Tracks

Tracks range from 1 to 20. A track can be 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10, 1-12, or 1-20. Any time you hit a die value on the track, you roll that die on the track's table. Tracks can be positive, building towards something great with higher results being more favorable, or negative, building towards something terrible with higher results getting worse and worse.

### Clocks

Clocks are like tracks, but they don't have associated rollable tables. Instead, predetermined things happen along the way. They're also circular and have slices. Like a pie. Maybe they should be called pies instead of clocks. Or clock pies. Or clies.

### Probabilities

When rolling multiple dice and trying to get a hit on each, multiply all the probabilities together:

**%1d x %2d**

When rolling two dice and only needing a hit on one, add the probability of the first die to the probability of the second die times the probability of the first die (This isn't quite right, but it's kind of close, I think):

**%1d + (%1d x %2d)**

### D4

- **Miss:** 0.75
- **At Least a Hit-:** 0.25

### D6

- **Miss:** 0.5
- **At Least a Hit-:** 0.5

### D8

- **Miss:** 0.375
- **At Least a Hit-** 0.625
	- **Hit-:** 0.375
	- **Hit:** 0.25

### D10

- **Miss:** 0.3
- **At Least a Hit-:** 0.7
	- **Hit-:** 0.3
	- **Hit:** 0.3
	- **Hit+:** 0.1

### D12

- **Miss:** 0.25
- **At Least a Hit-:** 0.75
	- **Hit-:** 0.25
	- **Hit:** 0.25
	- **Hit+:** 0.25
