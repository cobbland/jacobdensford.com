![A rough character sheet design with some dice sitting on it.](/images/newtrpg.jpg)

Here are the rules for a new tabletop roleplaying game I'm working on. They're incomplete and very much a work-in-progress, obviously. They're also incredibly generic right now. Eventually, once I settle on a setting, theme, and tone, I will rework some of the mechanics and the classes to more closely reflect those decisions. Consider these rules a "minimum viable product". I'd call this a version 0.0.1.

**Design Requirements:**

- Use all the dice
- No math
- No roll under mechanics (generally, rolling higher should be better)
- Options for both players and the GM rolling dice or just the players
- OSR (Old-School Renaissance/Revival) compatible-ish<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRVJNkOObIU">2</a></sup>
- NSR (New OSR or New Sworddream Renaissance) sensibilities, to an extent<sup><a href="https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/01/19/what-is-the-nsr-part-1">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://newschoolrevolution.com/2022/05/04/the-new-new-school-revolution">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/revisiting-the-nsr/">6</a></sup>
- Be simple enough to easily learn and run a one-shot but complex enough for campaign play and to offer extra depth for players who want it
- Have mechanics that reinforce the themes and tones of the game and offer options for emergent storytelling

**Design Inspiration**

- Numenera for the idea for the character description section
- Mothership for the idea to make points and tracks
- Apocalypse World for the concept of partial success
- Also Apocalypse World for clocks
- Mork Borg and Death in Space for lots of things
- Trophy for mathless dice rolls that instead rely on hits and misses
- So many others for so many things I can't even think of right now (I will add them as they come to me)

## Making Player Characters

Follow these steps to create a player character (or PC for short).

### Character Description

**NAME is a STYLE CLASS who MOTIVATION, but FLAW.**

A player character starts with a name, a style, a motivation, and a flaw. (A class will be chosen later. Or, When playing without classes, or when none of a PC's attributes are high enough to gain a class, roll or choose a background instead.)

Roll or choose a name, style, motivation, and flaw from the lists below or write your own that matches the format. (Feel free to slightly alter the format to make everything flow nicely.)

1|can't resist stealing everything that's not nailed down
2|will never trust again after what happened last time
3|can't forgive themselves for the mistakes of their past
4|is addicted to a powerful drug
5|is on the run because of a crime they didn't commit
6|Etc//
7|Etc//
8|Etc//
9|Etc//
10|Etc//
11|Etc//
12|Etc//

**Example character:** *Jane is a charming CLASS who seeks wealth to pay her family's debts, but she will never trust again after what happened last time.*

### Attributes

There are three attributes: Body (BOD), Intellect (INT), and Willpower (WIL). Their values range from a d4 to a d12. A PC's Body represents how strong and dexterous they are, Intellect how sharp-eyed and smart, and Willpower their force of will and magical potential.

Roll on the following table for each attribute to assign dice. (Alternatively, assign a d6 to each attribute, or assign an array of d4, d6, and d8.)

d8|Attribute Die
:--|:--
1-2|d4
3-6|d6
7-8|d8

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gets a d6 in BOD, a d8 in INT, and a d4 in WIL.*

### Classes

There are three main classes. They are Warrior, Thief, and Mage. Each specializes in one of the three attributes. The Warrior's focus is Body, the Thief's Intellect, and the Mage's Willpower.

Each class grants the PC feats. Also, each class can use their main attribute in a special way: they can spend 2 HP to reroll a die, 4 HP to increase a hit- to a hit or a hit to a hit+, 6 HP to turn a miss into a hit, or 8 HP to add an additional hit to a roll. (More on rolls, hits, misses, and HP later.)

PCs must have at least a D8 in a class's main attribute to take that class. Based on your attributes, choose one of the three main classes. Then choose one of that class's feats. If none of the PC's attributes are high enough, or when playing without classes, simply skip this section and choose or roll a background. (PCs can take a class after leveling up their attributes later on by getting the class feat option on the XP table.)

**Example character:** *Jane takes the Thief class, since she rolled a d8 for her INT. From her class, she chooses Sneak Attack.*

#### Warrior

//WORDS ABOUT THE WARRIOR//

##### Warrior Feats

- **Protect:** Take the BOD HP harm that someone nearby would have taken instead of them.
- **Berserk:** When the warrior passes a test with a weapon and deals harm, they may make additional tests with a weapon until they fail.
- //
- //

#### Thief

//WORDS ABOUT THE THIEF//

##### Thief Feats

- **Sneak Attack:** Deal double HP harm when attacking an enemy who is engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence.
- **Retry** Spend 2 INT HP in order to reroll skill dice.
- **Jack of all Trades:** Spend 2 INT HP to roll a d4 with any skill.
- //

#### Mage

//WORDS ABOUT THE Mage//

Start with one mage feat or three spells. (Whenever a mage takes the "class feat" option from the XP table, they can instead take another three spells.)

##### Mage Feats

- **Divination:** Make two WIL tests at dawn and save the results to use for yourself, a PC, or an NPC at any point throughout the coming day, for any kind of test.
- //
- //
- //

##### Magic

Mages can do magic. Each spell costs a number of WIL HP. Generally, a spell's effects increase the more HP is spent on it.

**Spells**

Spell Name|Effect|Cost
:--|---|--:
Fireball|2 BOD HP harm to 3 adjacent targets|2 WIL HP
//

#### Three More Classes

There are three more classes, each focusing on two of the three attributes instead of one. They are Cleric (BOD and WIL), Ranger (INT and WILL), and //CLASS// (BOD and INT). In order to take one of these classes, a PC needs to have at least a d8 in both of the classes main attributes.

For feats and spells, Clerics can choose from both the Warrior and the Mage options, Ranger the Thief and Mage, and //CLASS// the Warrior and Thief.

### Backgrounds

When playing without classes, or when none of a PC's attributes are high enough to gain a class, roll or choose a background instead. Each background grants a relevant skill at d4. (Alternatively, work with your GM to come up with your own background to pair with a skill.)

1d12|Background|Skill
:--|---|---
1|Etc|Etc//
2|Etc|Etc//
3|Etc|Etc//
4|Etc|Etc//
5|Etc|Etc//
6|Etc|Etc//
7|Etc|Etc//
8|Etc|Etc//
9|Etc|Etc//
10|Etc|Etc//
11|Etc|Etc//
12|Etc|Etc//

### Skills

There are twelve skills. Each is associated with one of the three attributes (but can be used with a different attribute if and when it makes sense). Skill values range from a d4 to a d12 once the skill is known.

Roll on the skill die table three times and assign each die to a skill. (Alternatively, assign a d6 to three skills, or assign an array of d4, d6, and d8.)

d8|Skill Die
:--|:--
1-4|d4
5-6|d6
7-8|d8

**BOD Skills:**

- Close Quarters Combat
- Defense
- Etc//
- Etc//

**INT Skills:**

- Perception
- Ranged Combat
- Skullduggery
- Stealth

**WIL Skills:**

- Persuasion
- Spellcasting
- Etc//
- Etc//

(Optionally, work with your DM to make up your own skills)

**Example character:** *Jane rolled and put her d4 in Skullduggery, d6 in Ranged Combat, and d8 in Perception.*

### Equipment

A PC has 4+BOD equipment slots (a d4 in BOD would grant 8 equipment slots, a d6 would grant 10, etc). Most items use one slot unless otherwise noted.

Roll or choose an equipment package from your class. Alternatively, start with 100 silver pieces (or SP) and purchase equipment from the equipment, weapons, and armor tables below.

1d6|Warrior Equipment
:--|---
1|Etc//
2|Etc//

1d6|Mage Equipment
:--|---

Then roll or choose one of these hundred trinkets. (Trinkets don't use equipment slots.)

1d100|Trinkets

Feel free to spend any remaining SP on the tables in the following sections.

**Example character:** *Jane rolls the fourth thief equipment pack and gets the first trinket.*

Equipment|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Item|What?|Price//

#### Weapons and Armor

Weapons deal hits to an opponent as BOD HP harm unless otherwise noted. Stronger weapons can turn a single hit into multiple points of harm.

Weapon|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Arrows|20 uses|10sp
Battle Axe|3 harm, 2 slots|35 SP
Bolts|10 uses|15sp
Club|1 harm|10 SP
Crossbow|3 harm, 2 slots|40 SP
Dagger|1 harm|10 SP
Flail|3 harm, 2 slots|35 SP
Greatsword|3 harm, 2 slots|45 SP
Handaxe|1 harm|15 SP
Longbow|2 harm|25 SP
Longsword|2 harm|30 SP
Mace|2 harm|25 SP
Shortsword|1 harm|20 SP
Shortbow|1 harm|15 SP
Staff|1 harm|5 SP
Warhammer|2 harm|30 SP

Wearing armor grants a PC armor points (or AP). At the PCs option, instead of taking a hit as BOD HP harm, they can take it as AP harm. Once out of AP, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.

Armor|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Shield|1 AP|20 SP
Light (fur, padded, leather)|2 AP, 2 slots|50 SP
Medium (scale, mail, etc)|3 AP, 3 slots|100 SP
Heavy (splint, plate, etc)|4 AP, 4 slots|200 SP

### Character Sheet

You don't need to print out a special character sheet for this game, though you can if you want to. All you really need is a piece of paper to record your character details on. At the top of your paper, write your character description. Under that, record your attribute dice and note your max and current HP for each attribute. Below that, list your skill dice. Then your feats, equipment, and SP. Lastly, write your current XP, noting the points on the track where you roll a die on the XP table.

That's it. Your character is ready to go.

**Example Character:**

*Jane is a charming thief who seeks wealth to pay her family's debts, but she will never trust again after what happened last time.*

*BOD: d6 -- 6/6 HP (2/2 AP) | INT: d8 -- 8/8 HP | WIL: d4 -- 4/4 HP*

*Perception: d8, Ranged Combat: d6, Skullduggery: d4*

*Sneak Attack: Deal double HP when attacking an enemy who is engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence*

*Equipment (5/10 slots): light armor (2 AP, 2 slots), dagger (1 HP), shortbow (1 HP), arrows (20), a cracked porcelain doll, 15 SP*

*XP: 0 (roll on 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20)*

## Playing the Game

### Tests

Whenever a PC attempts to do something that they could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain, they roll a test. First, they collect dice, one or two--one from their relevant attribute and one, if any, from a relevant skill. Then they roll, counting each die's result individually.

Roll|Result
:--|:--
1-3|Miss
4-6|Weak Hit (Hit-)
7-9|Hit
10-12|Strong Hit (Hit+)

Usually, if they rolled at least one hit (hit-, hit, or hit+), the test passes. The more hits above what the test required, the better the results. (Rarely, especially difficult tests might require two or more hits.)

If one of the dice is a hit-, there are unforeseen consequences. If one of the dice is a hit+, there is an unanticipated benefit. Two hit+ count as an extra hit (3 hits total) while two hit- still pass the test but extra trouble is introduced. (A result of one hit- and one hit+ cancel out any extra effects.)

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. Optionally, the PC can accept extra trouble in exchange for passing a failed test, the trouble getting worse the more hits needed to succeed.

#### Help or Hinder

When a PC is making a test, if another PC has a relevant skill, they may roll it (only the skill--not an associated attribute) and use a hit to either help or hinder that test, replacing a hit with a miss or adding the hit to the other PC's test. A hit+ or hit- on the help or hinder test causes unintended side effects to happens to the PC helping or hindering.

#### Contests (ConTests--get it?! Contested Tests?! Ha, ha, ha--get it?!)

When two or more PCs, or one or more PCs and one or more NPCs, are acting against each other, they collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. (In a tie, hit+ beats hit beats hit-, then higher number beats lower, then bigger die beats smaller. If the result is still tied, the situation stays the same as it was before.)

##### Combat

Combat involves a series of turns and rounds. A round lasts long enough to make a test and traverse a room--anywhere from six to twelve seconds.

First, an initiative contest decides the order of turns in the round. Then, PCs and NPCs each take their turn in order, repeating the same order in subsequent rounds until everyone is either dead, has surrendered, or has fled.

Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins each attack contest deals their hits as health point (or HP) harm to the opponent's relevant attribute HP pool (discussed in the next section).

### Health Points, Death, and Healing

Each attribute has its own health point (or HP) pool that is the size of the die for that attribute (4 for a d4, 6 for a d6, etc). When a pool is depleted, reduce the attribute's die by one and refill the pool. Each time a PC's attribute is reduced in such a way, they gain a wound--a lasting mark or sign on their struggle.

When any attribute is reduced beyond a d4, roll on the death table. When an attribute is reduced beyond a d4, tests cannot be made with that attribute and it's HP pool is 0. Any additional damage done to that attribute requires another roll on the death table.

**Death Table**

d4|Result
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d6 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d4 hours unless treated
4|Fall unconscious

HP pools can be healed by succeeding on a test using the relevant attribute. Whenever players take a few moments to rest, they can make this test. When resting for a full night, such a test automatically succeeds. Returning a reduced attribute die to normal is a more involved process, requiring special care or magic.

### Experience Points

PCs gain experience points (or XP) whenever they play up their style, follow their motivation, or allow their flaw to put them in a tight spot. (Players should call out these moments.) Additionally, the game master (or GM) will stipulate any other specific situations or actions that will award XP, such as defeating an enemy or disarming a trap.

PC's add their earned XP to their XP track. At each die number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20), they may choose to roll that die on the XP table. The further down the track, the better the options. Once a PC rolls or chooses an option, their XP track resets to zero.

**XP Table**

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Gain nothing and lose d8 XP
2-3|Gain nothing and lose d4 XP
4-6|Increase a skill's die or learn a new skill at d4
7-9|Gain a new class feat*
10-12|Gain a feat from a different class*
13-19|Increase an attribute's die
20|Choose one and reroll

*When not playing with classes, reroll on these options.

Another optional way to handle XP is for PCs to spend XP on specific advancements directly. 6 XP to increase a skill's die or learn a new skill at d4, 9 XP to gain a new class feature, 12 XP to gain a feature from a different class, and 20 XP to increase an attribute's die.

### Example of Play

//

## Game Master

The Game Master (or GM) facilitates the game, controlling the world and any non-player characters (or NPCs).

### When is it a test and when is it a contest?

If the PCs are acting against the world or something that can't act back, it's a test. If the PCs are acting against another PC, an NPC, or something else that can react to them, it's a contest.

### Who rolls dice?

If the GM doesn't want to roll dice, contests against NPCs are instead tests (usually requiring 1 hit, unless otherwise specified). In such a case, the possible consequences of a PC rolling a miss or a hit- allows the NPC to act against the PC. On the NPCs turn, the PC must roll a test to defend against the attack.

### Interpreting Rolls

When a test passes with no hit+ or hit-, that's easy. The GM simply gives the PC what they were aiming for. But when hit+ and hit- are involved, or when the PC fails the test but chooses to accept trouble to pass it anyway, things get more complicated.

Think of it this way: a hit+ is worth a hit and a half while a hit- is worth half a hit (even though it still counts as a hit for the purpose of determining if a test passes or not).

#### Strong Hits and Extra Hits

The easiest way to deal with a hit+ is to think of it as a hit and a half. So the thing the PC wanted comes to pass and a little extra. If the PC has more hits than they need, including the extra hit from rolling two hit+, The result should be proportionately better--twice as good with two hits when only one was needed, or three times as good if the two hits were hit+.

Some ideas for what to give a PC on a hit+ (an extra half-hit):

- They deal double harm
- They gain XP
//

Some ideas for what to give a PC with an extra hit:

//

#### Weak Hits and Failed Tests

The easiest way to deal with a hit- is to think of it as half a hit. What complications might come about if the PC succeeds, but only half as good as they had hoped to? You can also think of a hit- as half a miss. What consequences might failing the test introduce? You could bring half of that to the table.

Some ideas for when a PC rolls a hit-:

- Threaten them with impending danger
- Put them in a tight spot
- Deal harm
//

When a PC fails a test, they can choose to accept a consequence in exchange for passing the test regardless of their roll. DMs can also offer this option to PCs without them asking for it. These consequences should be worse than a hit-. They should be at least twice as bad, in fact, because they are the same as consequences for the PC rolling two hit-. They should also be worse the more hits would have been required to pass the test.

Some ideas for when a PC accepts trouble to turn a failed test into a passed one:

//

### Pools

Pools are collections of points that can be spent, reduced, replenished, etc.

### Tracks

Tracks range from 1 to 20. A track can be 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10, 1-12, or 1-20. Any time you hit a die value on the track, you roll that die on the track's table. Tracks can be positive, building towards something great with higher results being more favorable, or negative, building towards something terrible with higher results getting worse and worse.

### Clocks

Clocks are like tracks, but they don't have associated rollable tables. Instead, predetermined things happen along the way. They're also circular and have slices. Like a pie. Maybe they should be called pies instead of clocks. Or clock pies. Or clies.

### Probabilities

When rolling multiple dice and trying to get a hit on each, multiply all the probabilities together:

**%1d x %2d**

### D4

- **Miss:** 0.75
- **At Least a Hit-:** 0.25

### D6

- **At Least a Hit-** 0.625
	- **Hit-:** 0.375

### D10

- **Miss:** 0.3
- **At Least a Hit-:** 0.7
	- **Hit-:** 0.3
