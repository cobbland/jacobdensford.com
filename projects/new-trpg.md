![A rough character sheet design with some dice sitting on it.](/images/newtrpg.jpg)

Here are the rules for a new tabletop roleplaying game I'm working on. They're incomplete and very much a work-in-progress, obviously. They're also incredibly generic right now. Eventually, once I settle on a setting, theme, and tone, I will rework some of the mechanics and the classes to more closely reflect those decisions. Consider these rules a "minimum viable product". I'd call this a version 0.0.1.

**Design Requirements:**

- Use all the dice
- No math
- No roll under mechanics (generally, rolling higher should be better)
- Options for both players and the GM rolling dice or just the players
- OSR (Old-School Renaissance/Revival) compatible-ish<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRVJNkOObIU">2</a></sup>
- NSR (New OSR or New Sworddream Renaissance) sensibilities, to an extent<sup><a href="https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/01/19/what-is-the-nsr-part-1">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://newschoolrevolution.com/2022/05/04/the-new-new-school-revolution">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/revisiting-the-nsr/">6</a></sup>
- Be simple enough to easily learn and run a one-shot but complex enough for campaign play and to offer extra depth for players who want it
- Have mechanics that reinforce the themes and tones of the game and offer options for emergent storytelling

**Design Inspiration**

- Numenera for the idea for the character description section
- Mothership for the idea to make points and tracks
- Apocalypse World for the concept of partial success
- Also Apocalypse World for clocks
- Mork Borg and Death in Space for lots of things
- Trophy for mathless dice rolls that instead rely on hits and misses
- So many others for so many things I can't even think of right now (I will add them as they come to me)

## Player Characters

You are a //flavor text about who the PCs are in the world//.

You have a **name**, a **style**, a **class** or **background**, a **motivation**, and a **flaw**. You also have three **attributes**, a number of **skills**, and some **equipment**.

Your **name** is what people call you. It could be the name you were born with or a nickname you picked up along the way.

Your **style** is the main way you do things and move through the world.

Your **class** or **background** is what you do or what you've done with your life.

Your **motivation** is what drives you. It's the one thing you want more than anything else. If you're doing things right, every major action you take brings you one step closer to fulfilling your motivation.

Your **flaw** is the one thing about yourself that gets you into trouble most often. It is something to overcome. It is something to give in to.

Your **attributes** are body, intellect, and willpower. They represent how strong and dexterous you are, how sharp-eyed and smart, and your force of will and magical potential.

Your **skills** are what you're good at. They're broad abilities you've picked up over the years and learned to apply in difficult situations.

You have **equipment**. They're the tools you use to get the job done.

#### Weapons and Armor

Weapons deal hits to an opponent as harm to their BOD HP.

Weapon|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Arrows|20 uses|10sp
Battle Axe|3 harm, 2 slots|35 SP
Bolts|10 uses|15sp
Club|1 harm|10 SP
Crossbow|3 harm, 2 slots|40 SP
Dagger|1 harm|10 SP
Flail|3 harm, 2 slots|35 SP
Greatsword|3 harm, 2 slots|45 SP
Handaxe|1 harm|15 SP
Longbow|2 harm|25 SP
Longsword|2 harm|30 SP
Mace|2 harm|25 SP
Shortsword|1 harm|20 SP
Shortbow|1 harm|15 SP
Staff|1 harm|5 SP
Warhammer|2 harm|30 SP

Armor grants armor points (or AP). Instead of taking harm to your BOD HP, you may choose to take it to your AP. Once out of AP, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.

Armor|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Shield|1 AP|20 SP
Light (fur, padded, leather)|2 AP, 2 slots|50 SP
Medium (scale, mail, etc)|3 AP, 3 slots|100 SP
Heavy (splint, plate, etc)|4 AP, 4 slots|200 SP

### Character Advancement

You gain **experience points** (or XP) whenever you play up your style, follow your motivation, or allow your flaw to put you in a tight spot. The game master (or GM) may stipulate other situations that will award XP.

Add your earned XP to your XP track. At each die number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20), you may roll that die on the XP table and reduce your XP to zero.

Roll|XP Result
:--|---
1|Gain nothing and lose d8 XP
2-3|Gain nothing and lose d4 XP
4-6|Gain a new class feat or gain a class
7-9|Increase a skill's die or learn a new skill at d4
10-12|Gain a feat from a different class or switch classes
13-19|Increase an attribute's die
20|Choose one and reroll

**Example Character:**

*Jane is a charming thief who seeks wealth to pay her family's debts, but she will never trust again after what happened last time.*

*BOD: d6 -- 6/6 HP (2/2 AP) | INT: d8 -- 8/8 HP | WIL: d4 -- 4/4 HP*

*Perception: d8, Ranged Combat: d6, Skullduggery: d4*

*Sneak Attack: Deal double HP when attacking an enemy who is engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence*

*Equipment (5/10 slots): light armor (2 AP, 2 slots), dagger (1 HP), shortbow (1 HP), arrows (20), a cracked porcelain doll, 15 SP*

*XP: 0 (roll on 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20)*

## Playing the Game

### Tests

Whenever you attempt to do something that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain, roll a **test**. Collect dice: one from your relevant attribute and one, if any, from a relevant skill. Roll, counting each die's result individually.

Roll|Result
:--|:--
1-3|Miss
4-6|Weak Hit (Hit-)
7-9|Hit
10-12|Strong Hit (Hit+)

The test passes if you roll at least one **hit**. The more hits you get, the better the results. (Rarely, especially difficult tests might require two or more hits.)

If a die is a **weak hit**, there are unforeseen consequences. If a die is a **strong hit**, there is an unanticipated benefit. These effects stack and do not cancel each other out.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You may choose to accept extra trouble in exchange for passing a failed test.

#### Modifying Tests

You may use your class's main attribute(s) in a special way: you can spend 2 HP to reroll a die, 4 HP to increase a weak hit to a hit or a hit to a strong hit, 6 HP to turn a miss into a hit, or 8 HP to add an additional hit to your roll.

#### Help or Hinder

When someone else makes a test you may roll a relevant skill die and use a hit to either help or hinder them, replacing their hit with a miss or adding a hit to their test.

#### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. In a tie, a strong hit beats a hit beats a weak hit, higher numbers beats lower, then bigger dice beat smaller.

##### Combat

Combat involves a series of rounds made up of turns. A round lasts long enough to make a test and traverse a room--anywhere from six to twelve seconds.

An initiative contest decides the order of turns that PCs and NPCs each take each round. Rounds continuing until everyone is either dead, surrendered, or fled.

Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins each attack contest deals their hits as harm.

### Health Points, Death, and Healing

Each attribute has a health point (or HP) pool that is the size of its die. When a pool is depleted, reduce the attribute's die by one and refill the pool. Each time your attribute is reduced in such a way, gain a wound--a lasting mark or sign of your struggle.

When an attribute is reduced below d4, tests can no longer be made with it and it's HP pool is zero. Roll on the death table.

d4|Death Result
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d6 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d4 hours unless treated
4|Fall unconscious

Whenever you take about an hour to rest, you may replenish an HP pool by succeeding on a test using its attribute. When you rest for a full night, the test automatically succeeds. Returning a reduced attribute die to normal is a more involved process, requiring special care or magic.
