![A rough character sheet design with some dice sitting on it.](/images/newtrpg.jpg)

Here are the rules for a new tabletop roleplaying game I'm working on. They're incomplete and very much a work-in-progress, obviously. They're also incredibly generic right now. Eventually, once I settle on a setting, theme, and tone, I will rework some of the mechanics and the classes to more closely reflect those decisions. I'd call this a version 0.0.1.

> *Throughout this document, design notes will be denoted by block quotes.*

> **Design Requirements:**
>
> - Use all the dice
> - No math
> - Options for both players and the GM rolling dice or just the players
> - OSR (Old-School Renaissance/Revival) compatible-ish
> - NSR (New OSR or New Sworddream Renaissance) sensibilities, to an extent
> - Be simple enough to easily learn and run a one-shot but complex enough for campaign play and to offer extra depth for players who want it
> - Have mechanics that reinforce the themes and tones of the game and offer options for emergent storytelling

## Making Player Characters

Follow these steps to create a player character (or PC for short).

### Character Description

**NAME is a STYLE CLASS who MOTIVATION, but FLAW.**

A player character starts with a name, a style, a motivation, and a flaw. (A class will be chosen later. Or, when playing without classes, replace that portion of the description with "man", "woman", "human", "baker", "noble", etc.)

Roll or choose a name, style, motivation, and flaw from the lists below or write your own that matches the format. (Feel free to slightly alter the format to make everything flow nicely.)

3|Etc
4|Etc
5|Etc
6|Etc
7|Etc
8|Etc
9|Etc
10|Etc
11|Etc
12|Etc

**Example character:** *Jane is a charming CLASS who seeks wealth to pay her family's debts, but she will never trust again after what happened last time.*

> Flaw might be replaced with Worst Outcome.

### Attributes

There are three attributes: Body (BOD), Intellect (INT), and Willpower (WIL). A PC's Body represents how strong and dexterous they are, Intellect how sharp-eyed and smart, and Willpower their force of will and magical potential.

Roll on the following table for each attribute to assign dice. (Alternatively, assign a d6 to each attribute, or assign a d6 to one, a d8 to one, and a d4 to one.)

d8|Attribute Die
:--|:--
1-4|d4
5-6|d6
7-8|d8

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gets a d6 in BOD, a d8 in INT, and a d4 in WIL.*

### Classes

There are three main classes. They are Warrior, Thief, and Mage. Each specializes in one of the three attributes. The Warrior's focus is Body, the Thief's Intellect, and the Mage's Willpower.

Each class grants the PC certain special abilities.

Based on your attributes, choose one of the three main classes. Then choose one of that class's abilities. (Or, when playing without classes, simply skip this section.)

**Example character:** *Jane takes the Thief class, since her best attribute is INT. From her class, she chooses Sneak Attack.*

> There might be six additional classes that focus on combinations of the three attributes.

> Class abilities shouldn't negate something creative that everyone should be able to do. Instead, they should grant specific thematic mechanics for doing something cool, or grant new abilities that a regular person wouldn't be able to do. For example, a thief might be tricky so they have an ability that lets them "cheat" on a roll, or a warrior might have more grit so they can take hits on their STR HP track to push a miss into a hit. Or something like that. Flavorful, thematic, mechanics. Classes probably also have special tracks and/or clocks.

#### Warrior

WORDS ABOUT THE WARRIOR

##### Warrior Abilities

-

#### Thief

WORDS ABOUT THE THIEF

##### Thief Abilities

- **Sneak Attack:** Deal double HP when attacking an enemy who is engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence.

#### Mage

WORDS ABOUT THE Mage

Start with one mage ability or three spells. (Whenever a mage takes the "class ability" option from the XP table, they can instead take another three spells.)

##### Mage Abilities

- **Divination:** Make a WIL test at dawn and save the result to use for yourself, a PC, or an NPC at any point throughout the coming day, for any kind of test. (Taking this ability multiple times allows you to roll and retain more additional uses.)

##### Magic

Mages can do magic. Each spell costs magic points (or MP). When casting a spell, the Mage adds the spent magic points to their magic point track, rolling on the magic point table when they hit a die number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20). The results get worse the higher on the track the Mage goes.

**MP Table**

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Recover from 1d8 MP
2-3|The spell's effects are lessened
4-6|The spell costs twice as much MP (if this causes you to have to roll again, do so)
7-8|The spell also effects someone you'd rather it not (including yourself)
9-10|You instead cast the worst spell possible
11-12|The spell cannot be cast again until dawn
13-16|Forget the spell you just cast
17-19|Forget 1d4 spells, including the one you just cast
20|Reduce WIL by one die

**Spells**

Spell Name|Effect|MP Cost
:--|---|--:
Fireball|1 BOD HP per MP cost to 1 target per MP cost|2 MP

### Skills

There are twelve skills. Each is associated with one of the three attributes (but can be used with a different attribute if and when it makes sense).

Roll on the skill die table three times and assign each die to a skill. (Alternatively, assign a d6 to three skills, or assign a d6 to one, a d8 to one, and a d4 to one.)

d8|Skill Die
:--|:--
1-4|d4
5-6|d6
7-8|d8

**BOD Skills:**

- Close Quarters Combat
- Defense
- Etc
- Etc

**INT Skills:**

- Perception
- Ranged Combat
- Skullduggery
- Stealth

**WIL Skills:**

- Persuasion
- Spellcasting
- Etc
- Etc

(Optionally, work with your DM to make up your own skills)

**Example character:** *Jane rolled and put her d4 in Skullduggery, d6 in Ranged Combat, and d8 in Perception.*

### Equipment

A PC has 4+BOD equipment slots (a d4 in BOD would mean 8 pieces of equipment, a d6 10, a d8 12, etc). Most items use one slot unless otherwise noted.

Roll or choose an equipment package from your class. Alternatively, start with 100 silver pieces (or SP) and purchase equipment from the equipment, weapons, and armor tables below.

1d6|Warrior Equipment
:--|---
1|Etc
2|Etc
3|Etc
4|Etc

1d6|Thief Equipment
:--|---

5|Etc
6|Etc

1d6|Mage Equipment
:--|---
1|Etc
2|Etc
3|Etc

5|Etc
6|Etc

Then roll or choose one of these hundred trinkets. (Trinkets don't use equipment slots.)

1d100|Trinkets
:--|---

Feel free to spend any remaining SP on the following equipment table.

Equipment|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Item|What?|Price
Item|What?|Price
Item|What?|Price
Item|What?|Price

**Example character:** *Jane rolls the fourth thief equipment pack and gets the first trinket.*

#### Weapons and Armor

Weapons deal hits to an opponent's BOD as health points, unless otherwise noted. Stronger weapons can turn a single hit into multiple HP of BOD damage.

Weapon|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Arrows|20 arrows|10sp
Battle Axe|3 HP, 2 slots|35 SP
Bolts (10)|10 bolts|15sp
Club|1 HP|10 SP
Crossbow|3 HP, 2 slots|40 SP
Dagger|1 HP|10 SP
Flail|3 HP, 2 slots|35 SP
Greatsword|3 HP, 2 slots|45 SP
Handaxe|1 HP|15 SP
Longbow|2 HP|25 SP
Longsword|2 HP|30 SP
Mace|2 HP|25 SP
Shortsword|1 HP|20 SP
Shortbow|1 HP|15 SP
Staff|1 HP|5 SP
Warhammer|2 HP|30 SP

Wearing armor grants a PC an armor point track. At the PCs option, instead of taking a hit as a BOD health point, they can take it as an armor point (or AP). Once the AP track is full, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.

Armor|Details|Cost
:--|---|--:
Shield|1 AP|20 SP
Light (fur, padded, leather)|2 AP, 2 slots|50 SP
Medium (scale, mail, etc)|3 AP, 3 slots|100 SP
Heavy (slint, plate, etc)|4 AP, 4 slots|200 SP

### Character Sheet

You don't need to print out a special character sheet for this game, though you can if you want to. All you really need is a piece of paper to record your character details on. At the top of your paper, write your character description. Under that, record your attribute dice and make squares or circles beside them to represent your HP tracks (alternatively, just record your max and current HP for each attribute). Below that, list your skill dice. Then your class abilities, equipment, and SP. Lastly, write your current XP, noting the points on the track where you roll a die or pick options (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20).

That's it. Your character is ready to go.

**Example Character:**

*Jane is a charming thief who seeks wealth to pay her family's debts, but she will never trust again after what happened last time.*

*BOD: d6 -- 0/6 HP (0/2 AP) | INT: d8 -- 0/8 HP | WIL: d4 -- 0/4 HP*

*Perception: d8, Ranged Combat: d6, Skullduggery: d4*

*Sneak Attack: Deal double HP when attacking an enemy who is engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence*

*Equipment (5/10 slots): light armor (2 AP, 2 slots), dagger (1 HP), shortbow (1 HP), arrows (20), a cracked porcelain doll, 15 SP*

*XP: 0 (roll on 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20)*

## Playing the Game

### Tests

Whenever a PC attempts to do something and the outcome is uncertain, they roll a test. First, they collect dice, one or two--one from their relevant attribute and one, if any, from a relevant skill. Then they roll, counting each die's roll individually.

Roll|Result
:--|:--
1-3|Miss
4-6|Hit-
7-9|Hit
10-12|Hit+

Usually, if they rolled at least one hit (hit-, hit, or hit+), the test passes. (Rarely, especially difficult tests might require two or more hits.)

If one of the dice is a hit-, there are unforeseen consequences. If one of the dice is a hit+, there is an unanticipated benefit. Two hit+ count as an extra hit (3 hits total) while two hit- instead count as a miss (0 hits). (A result of one hit- and one hit+ cancel out any extra effects.)

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. Optionally, the PC can accept extra trouble in exchange for passing a failed test.

> In general, needing more than one hit really under-powers the PCs and kind of breaks the probabilities I'm aiming for with the game, so such requirements should be used with care.

#### Help or Hinder

When a PC is making a test, if another PC has a relevant skill, they may roll it (only the skill--not an associated attribute) and use a hit to either help or hinder that test, replacing a miss with a hit or a hit with a miss. A hit+ or hit- on the help or hinder test causes unintended side effects to happens to the PC helping or hindering.

#### Contests (ConTests--get it?! Contested Tests?! Ha, ha, ha--get it?!)

When two PCs or a PC and an NPC are acting against each other, they collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. (In a tie, hit+ beats hit beats hit-, then higher number beats lower, then bigger die beats smaller.)

##### Combat

Combat involves a series of contests. First, an initiative contest decides the order of action. Then, whoever wins each attack contest deals their hits to the opponent's relevant HP track (discussed in the next section).

### Health Points, Death, and Healing

Each attribute has its own health point (or HP) track that is the length of the die for that attribute, and each has an associated rollable table, with better results the higher you go, from reducing the associated attribute to healing HP. When a track is filled, roll the associated attribute die and consult the relevant table to see what happens. When any attribute is reduced beyond a d4, the PC dies.

**BOD HP Table**

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Mortal wound: reduce BOD die, fall unconscious, and die in 1d4 minutes without aid
2-3|Bloody wound: 1d4 HP to INT and WIL, fall unconscious, and die in 1d6 minutes without aid
4-6|Severed limb: roll 1d6 and lose an arm on a 1-2, a leg on a 3-4, a hand on a 5, or a finger on a 6
7-8|Etc
9-10|Etc
11-12|Etc
13-16|Etc
17-19|Heal 1d6 BOD HP
20|Heal 1d12 BOD HP

**INT HP Table**

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Shattered mind: reduce INT die, fall unconscious, and die in 1d4 minutes without aid
2-3|Broken mind: reduce one skill die, fall unconscious, and die in 1d6 minutes without aid
4-6|Etc
7-8|Etc
9-10|Etc
11-12|Etc
13-16|Etc
17-19|Heal 1d6 INT HP
20|Heal 1d12 INT HP

**WIL HP Table**

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Severed soul: reduce WIL die, fall unconscious, and die in 1d4 minutes without aid
2-3|Leaking soul: lose access to one spell, fall unconscious, and die in 1d6 minutes without aid
4-6|Severed soul: your soul leaves its body, the body falls unconscious and dies in 1d6 minutes without your soul passing a WIL test (test once per minute)
7-8|Etc
9-10|Etc
11-12|Etc
13-16|Etc
17-19|Heal 1d6 WIL HP
20|Heal 1d12 WIL HP

HP tracks can be healed relatively easily. Whenever players take some downtime, they can roll their attribute die and heal that many hit points, up to their maximum. Returning a reduced attribute die to normal is a more involved process, requiring special care, training, or magic.

### Experience Points

PCs gain experience points (or XP) whenever they play up their style, follow their motivation, or allow their flaw to put them in a tight spot. (Players should call out these moments.) Additionally, the game master (or GM) will stipulate any other specific situations or actions that will award XP, such as defeating an enemy or disarming a trap.

PC's add their earned XP to their XP track. At each die number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20), they may roll (or choose options) from the XP table. The further down the track, the better the options, from gaining new skills and class abilities to increasing the die of a skill or attribute. (Skill and Attribute dice start at d4 and go up to d12.)

XP can also be spent to improve test rolls. Spend 2 XP to increase a hit- to a hit or a hit to a hit+, spend 4 XP to turn a miss into a hit, or spend 6 XP to add an additional hit to a roll.

**XP Table**

Roll|Result
:--|---
1|Gain nothing and lose all XP
2-3|Gain nothing
4-9|Increase a skill's die or learn a new skill
10-12|Gain a new class feature*
13-16|Gain a feature from a different class*
17-19|Increase an attribute's die
20|Choose one and reroll

*When not playing with classes, reroll on these options.

## Game Master

The Game Master (or GM) facilitates the game, controlling the world and any non-player characters (or NPCs).

### When is it a test and when is it a contest?

If the PCs are acting against the world or something that can't act back, it's a test. If the PCs are acting against an NPC or something else that can react to them, it's a contest.

### Who rolls dice?

If the GM doesn't want to roll dice, contests against NPCs are instead tests. In such a case, the PC rolling a miss or a hit- allows the NPC to act against the PC.

### Interpreting Rolls

When a test passes with no hit+ or hit-, that's easy. The GM simply gives the PC what they were aiming for. But when hit+ and hit- are involved, or when the PC fails the test but chooses to accept trouble to pass it anyway, things get more complicated.

Think of it this way: a hit+ is worth a hit and a half while a hit- is worth half a hit (even though it still counts as a hit for the purpose of determining if a test passes or not).

#### Hit+ and Extra Hits

The easiest way to deal with a hit+ is to think of it as a hit and a half. So the thing the PC wanted comes to pass and a little extra. If the PC has more hits than they need, including the extra hit from rolling two hit+, The result should be proportionately better--twice as good with two hits when only one was needed, or three times as good if the two hits were hit+.

Some ideas for what to give a PC on a hit+ (an extra half-hit):

- They deal double damage
- They gain XP

Some ideas for what to give a PC with an extra hit:

-

#### Hit- and Failed Tests

The easiest way to deal with a hit- is to think of it as half a hit. What complications might come about if the PC succeeds, but only half as good as they had hoped to? You can also think of a hit- as half a miss. What consequences might failing the test introduce? You could bring half of that to the table.

Some ideas for when a PC rolls a hit-:

- Threaten them with impending danger
- Put them in a tight spot
- Deal damage

When a PC failed a test, they can choose to except a consequence in exchange for passing the test regardless of their roll. DMs can also offer this option to PCs without them asking for it. These consequences should be worse than a hit-. They should be at least twice as bad, in fact.

Some ideas for when a PC accepts trouble to turn a failed test into a passed one:

-

### Tracks

Tracks range from 1 to 20. A track can be 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10, 1-12, or 1-20. Any time you hit a die value on the track, you roll that die on the track's table. Tracks can be positive, building towards something great with higher results being more favorable, or negative, building towards something terrible with higher results getting worse and worse.

### Clocks

Clocks are like tracks, but they don't have associated rollable tables. Instead, predetermined things happen along the way. They're also circular and have slices. Like a pie. Maybe they should be called pies instead of clocks. Or clock pies. Or clies.

### Probabilities

When rolling multiple dice and trying to get a hit on each, multiply all the probabilities together:

**%1d x %2d**

When rolling two dice and only needing a hit on one, add the probability of the first die to the probability of the second die times the probability of the first die (This isn't quite right, but it's kind of close, I think):

**%1d + (%1d x %2d)**
