# Centauri Womb

*A freelance spaceship captain on the verge of losing everything embarks on a mission to solve a decades-old mystery; but when she is trapped on a hostile planet with little hope of escape, she must learn to accept the mistakes of her past before they define her future.*

## What

Centauri Womb is a science fiction novel.

## Status

I’m about two thirds of the way through the second draft. Trying really hard to finish by the end of the year, but we’ll see.
