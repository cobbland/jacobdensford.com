# Centauri Womb

*In a not-too-distant future where mega-corporations and multi-planetary governments wage a cold war for control of humanity, a down on her luck freelance spaceship captain and recently disinherited playboy embark on a mission to solve a centuries-old mystery surrounding the loss of an ancient generation ship; but when they’re trapped on a hostile planet and confronted by a mysterious microorganism, a corrupt prince seeking to rule the galaxy, and an ancient power with unknown machinations, they must learn to come to terms with the past or risk it defining the future.*
