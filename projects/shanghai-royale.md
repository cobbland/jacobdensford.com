# Shanghai Royale

A card game using standard Shanghai rules with the following exceptions:

- Up to sixteen players may play at once using one deck per two players (rounded up).
- At the end of each hand, players are eliminated using the chosen elimination rules (see below) at a rate that leaves four players playing the last hand.
- As players are eliminated, the number of decks used is reduced. (Each deck should have a different backing for easy removal.)

## Elimination Rules

Choose one or a combination of elimination rules before the game begins.

### Highest Score

Players with the highest scores are eliminated.

### Fifty-Fives

Players are eliminated for having more points than the number of completed hands times fifty-five. If used with **Highest Score**, fifty-fives are eliminated first.

### Sudden Death

All players caught are eliminated. If used with **Highest Score** and/or **Fifty-Fives**, players caught are eliminated first.

## Alternative Rules

Choose none, one, or a combination of alternative rules before the game begins.

### Two Standing

Rather than playing down to four players, the game is played down to two. If also using **Three’s a Crowd**, the game is played down to three.

### Three’s a Crowd

Rather than using one deck per two players and ending the game with four players, use one per three and end the game with six.

### Half Game

Only play the first four hands.

## Random Game

Instead of choosing elimination and alternative rules, roll a die (1d6) for one or both.

For **Elimination Rules**:

- 1, **Highest Score**.
- 2, **Fifty-Fives**.
- 3, **Sudden Death**.
- 4–5, Two rules.
- 6, All three.

For **Alternative Rules**:

- 1, **Two Standing**.
- 2, **Three’s a Crowd**.
- 3, **Half Game**.
- 4–5, Two rules.
- 6, All three.
