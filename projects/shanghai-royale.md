# Shanghai Royale

*v1.2*

A card game using standard Shanghai rules with the following exceptions:

- Up to sixteen players may play at once using one deck per two players (rounded up).
- At the end of each hand, players are eliminated using the chosen elimination rules (see below) until only four players remain.
- As players are eliminated, the number of decks used is reduced. (Each deck should have a different backing for easy removal.)

## Elimination Rules

Choose one or more elimination rules before the game begins. If playing with multiple rules, decide the order in which the eliminations are prioritized.

### Eighty-Fives

Players are eliminated for having more points than the number of completed hands times eighty-five.

### Highest Score

Players with the highest scores are eliminated at a rate that leaves the appropriate number of players playing the last hand.

### Sudden Death

All players caught are eliminated.

## Alternative Rules

Choose none, one, or a combination of alternative rules before the game begins.

### Bank Your Buys

Everyone has two buys each hand. Unused buys roll over to subsequent hands.

### Blade of Fools

Jokers may be played face up and sideways in front of a player at any time, each increasing that player’s points gained that hand by 20.

### Corrected Hand Order

The order of hands is: 2S, 2R, 1S1R, 2S1R, 1S2R, 3S, 3R.

### Down is Out

As soon as one player goes down, the hand is over.

### Endless Eliminations

Eliminations continue even after players have been reduced to the normal final amount.

### Everyone Plays

Play continues until everyone has had at least one turn.

### Extra Hand

An extra hand is added at the end: 2S2R.

### Final Deck

Rather than playing down to two decks and the corresponding number of players, the game is played down to one deck and the corresponding number of players.

### Fool’s Protection

Jokers may be played face up in front of a player at any time, each reducing the points gained that hand by 20.

### Half Game

Only play the first four hands.

### Last Hand

When only the final players remain, the first to go down wins the game.

### No Funny Business

Jokers are not used.

### Persistent Jokers

Jokers remain in the game, even after the rest of their deck is removed.

### Quantum Aces

Aces can be high or low, connecting kings to twos.

### Three’s a Crowd

Rather than using one deck per two players and ending the game with four players, use one per three and end the game with six.

### Variable Contract

Each player may go down with any hand, as long as they haven't gone down with it yet during the current game.
