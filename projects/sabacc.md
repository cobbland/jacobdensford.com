Sabacc has been called the greatest card game in the galaxy. True or not, it's at least the most popular. And the most varied. Depending on who you ask, there are dozens, if not hundreds of variations of sabacc. But they all have a few things in common: they're played with a special deck of cards and rely heavily on betting, bluffing, and chance.

I've compiled and clarified all the versions of [sabacc](/sabacc) I could find.

### Status

I might dable with it and refine it from time to time, but this is more or less done. I'd call it version 0.9. Well, I do still need to add the new game introduced for the Galactic Star Cruiser. But I don't know when I'll ever get around to it.
