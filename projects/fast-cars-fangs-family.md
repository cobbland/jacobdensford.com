Fast Cars with Fangs and Family is a tabletop roleplaying game based on the beloved movie franchise, Fast & Furious, in which players take on the rolls of members of a crew that's more than just a crew—they're family—who have made an unholy pact with an ancient order of vampires who are more than just vampires—they're sports cars.

I'm in the early stages of conceptualizing and seeing what mechanics best fit which narrative elements, but I hope to be done in time for the eventual release of F10.
