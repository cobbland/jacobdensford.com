# Movies and Shows

## *Predator*

It was alright. Felt like it dragged a little near the beginning and in the middle. Still, probably worth watching.

I watched this movie on the 13th of August, 2022. **I sort of recommend it.**

## *Prey*

I decided I would take the Fall to watch through some horror science fiction series, starting with *Predator*. Even though *Prey* was the most recent, it was what got me excited about the idea, so I started there.

It was pretty good! It was nice to see them spend some time on character. I picked up on a few callbacks to the original movie, which were fun. At least, I think I did. Haven't watched it since I was nine or ten. (It was the fist rated R movie I ever saw. Got in big trouble, too.)

I watched this movie on the 11th of August, 2022. **I recommend it.**
