# Movies and Shows

The list below is no longer maintained. For more, check out the <a href="/tags/video">video</a> and <a href="/tags/reviews">reviews</a> tags.

## *Cowboy Bebop*

Everything I ever wanted. I don't know how it took me so long to finally watch this show. The vibes are immaculate. **I strongly recommend it.**

(I also watched the live-action Netflix adaptation, which I really enjoyed.)

## *Alien vs. Predator*

Not a great movie, but I kind of enjoyed it. It would make a really good dungeon for a tabletop roleplaying game.

If you managed to watch the last one, you'll probably make it through this one. **I don't recommend it.**

## *Predator 2*

Very campy. Mostly bad. Also good.

If that's the kind of thing you're into, you might like it. **I don't recommend it.**

## *Predator*

It was alright. Felt like it dragged a little near the beginning and in the middle. Still, probably worth watching.

I watched this movie on the 13th of August, 2022. **I sort of recommend it.**

## *Prey*

I decided I would take the Fall to watch through some horror science fiction series, starting with *Predator*. Even though *Prey* was the most recent, it was what got me excited about the idea, so I started there.

It was pretty good! It was nice to see them spend some time on character. I picked up on a few callbacks to the original movie, which were fun. At least, I think I did. Haven't watched it since I was nine or ten. (It was the fist rated R movie I ever saw. Got in big trouble, too.)

I watched this movie on the 11th of August, 2022. **I recommend it.**
