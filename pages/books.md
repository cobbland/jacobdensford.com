This page is a response to me being dissatisfied with Goodreads and the like. I want a place to track the books I've read and show my recommendations, and I want it to be my own place. So, here it is: my own book place. Up first is what I'm currently reading, followed by the books I've read recently and recommend, and then my favorite books of all time. (I won't be posting about books I read and didn't like or books I didn't even finish. No need for all that negativity.)

## *Mistborn: The Final Empire* by Brandon Sanderson

This is what I'm reading now. I only recently started reading [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)'s [Cosmere](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/what-is-the-cosmere/). So far, I'm really liking it. His writing is so clear, his worlds so detailed and creative. He does stuff with magic I've never seen before. Really looking forward to continuing this journey.

I'm using Marvin RÃ¶sch's excellent [Cosmere reading guide](https://paleocrafter.github.io/reading-order/#/) to determine the order in which I tackle the Cosmere, mostly following in-universe chronology, with one exceptions to avoid major spoilers (Mistborn: Secret History).

## *Elantris* by Brandon Sanderson

I finished reading this book at the end of May 2022 and can't recommend it enough.

## *Station Eleven* by Emily St John Mandel

I read this book in April 2022. I recommend it.
