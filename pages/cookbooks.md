I used to have a lot of cookbooks. Sadly, I left them in Texas years ago. I have them all as ebooks now. But it’s not the same. I’ve found cookbooks are best as physical objects. I used to write notes on the recipes&mdash;what I changed, and if it made the dish better or worse&mdash;and I liked opening to a recipe I’d made many times and seeing my saucy fingerprints on the page. These days, I mostly cook by feel. But I would be lost had I not read these several cookbooks once upon a time.

## *An Everlasting Meal* by Tamar Adler

This is the most important cookbook to me. Well, it’s less a cookbook and more a book about cooking; full of methods, philosophy, and how food intersects with life. It’s the most recent book I’ve read on this list. But if I could do it all over again, this would be my first.

## *Twelve Recipes* by Cal Peternell

This is my next most important cookbook. And coincidentally&mdash;or maybe not&mdash;the author of the first book on this list and the author of this book have spent a lot of time in kitchens together. (At least, I think they did. I might be misremembering.) *Twelve Recipes* was written as a guide to a young adult going off to college. This book teaches almost all the cooking technique and theory a home cook could ever need. I love this book and it’s the first one I turn to when I need a recipe for something.

## *Every Grain of Rice* by Fuchsia Dunlop

This was the first cookbook I cooked all the way through, only skipping a handful of recipes. It was also the book that I learned most of my cooking methods and techniques from. (I blame this book for all the garlic I burn&mdash;it’s not my fault.) It’s kind of specific, being only one region’s cuisine in one country. But it’s very worthwhile.

## *Mastering the Art of French Cooking* by Julia Child

Here’s a classic. And a fancy one. This book teaches the “correct” way to cook a dish, the “impressive” way, the French way. Some of the recipes are even usable once you've translate them from nonsense. Whenever I want to try cooking something new, first I check to see if there’s a recipe in *Twelve Recipes*. Then I check this book. (Lastly, I’ll search online and usually find something on [Serious Eats](https://seriouseats.com/). And then I’ll make the dish using a combination of whatever I’ve found. (Apparently, there is also a sequel. But I’ve never read it.)

## Bonus: *Home Made*, *Home Made Winter*, and *Home Made Summer* by Yvette van Boven

I love these three cookbooks. Especially *Home Made Winter*. I never used them as often as the others, but they contain a lot of fun recipes that I’ve found myself coming back to again and again.
