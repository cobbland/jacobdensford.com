# Video Games

## Currently playing...

I'm never just playing one game. And I almost never finish any of them. But, right now, I'm periodically enjoying *Disco Elysium*, *The Witcher 3*, and *Baldur's Gate 3*.

## *Mortal Shell*

It's like tighter Dark Souls with a few things done better and a few things done not as good. I liked it.

Played in May 2024. **I recommend it.**

## *Scorn*

This game is absolutely not for everyone. The puzzles were good. The combat not so much. Still liked it, though.

Started sometime in 2022 and finished in June of 2023. **I recommend it.**

## *MINERVA: Metastasis*

A great unofficial addition to Half-Life.

Played in June of 2023. **I recommend it.**

## *Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy*

Not sure why I waited so long to finally get into this. Great game. Best lightsaber combat ever. The multiplayer is really where the game shines, even today.

Played in June of 2023. **I recommend it.**

## *Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast*

Jedi Outcast is a pretty good game, even twenty years later. The gunplay is rough and swimming is dumb, but the lightsaber combat and force powers are fun. And I enjoyed the occasional puzzle.

Played in June of 2023. **I recommend it.**

## *Tomb Raider (2013)*

This is a game like games used to be games.

Played in May of 2023. **I recommend it.**

## *Dark Souls*

Dark Souls takes advantage of its medium to do things I've never seen in a game before.

Played in the spring of 2023. **I highly recommend it.**

## *Control*

Compelling story and even better gameplay.

Played in the first few months of 2023. **I recommend it.**

## *Celeste*

It's a challenging platformer with a heartwarming, if a little weak, story.

Played off and on for most of 2022. **I recommend it.**
