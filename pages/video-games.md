# Video Games

## Currently playing *Disco Elysium* and *Scorn*

I'm never just playing one games. And I almost never finish any of them. But, right now, I'm periodically enjoying *Disco Elysium* and creeping my way through *Scorn*.

## *Control*

**I recommend it.**

## *Celeste*

Played off and on for most of 2022. It's a challanging platformer with a heartwarming, if a little weak, story. **I recommend it.**
