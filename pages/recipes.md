Here are some recipes I came up with. Most are a combination of other recipes, mixed together in a way I enjoy. I'll try to give citations wherever I remember them.

A note on measurements: Someday I will convert all of these recipes to be measured by weight. But, for now, t = teaspoon, T = tablespoon, c = cup, etc.

Oh, and degrees are in Fahrenheit.
