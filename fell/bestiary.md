# Bestiary

**Beasts and beings** have a name, a description, and a drive. Unless otherwise noted, they have 5 HP, 0 A, and d6 attributes.
If they are…

- meant to be exceptionally easy to overcome, their HP and attributes are lower
- competent, their HP and attributes are higher
- good at something specific, they have a skill
- tough, they have armor
- quick, they have more HP
- magical, they have spells

Beasts and beings in the Fell are either mortal (M), faërie (F), or daemon (D).

Attacks against faërie and daemon beings from weapons made of pure iron have advantage.

Knowing a faërie or daemon being's true name counts as leverage.
