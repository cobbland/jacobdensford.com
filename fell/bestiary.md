# Bestiary

Beasts and beings in the Fell are either mortal (M), faërie (F), or daemon (D).

Attacks against faërie and daemon beings from weapons made of pure iron have advantage.

Knowing a faërie or daemon being's true name counts as leverage.

Unless otherwise noted, HP is assumed to be 5, armor 0, and each ability d6.
