*Fell* is a [tabletop roleplaying game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) for at least two players.

One player is the referee, playing the world and its inhabitants. They adjudicate the rules, make rulings, and describe the situations the player characters find themselves in.

The rest are player characters (PCs); acting as knaves, wretches, and scoundrels seeking fortune in a corrupted land filled with danger. They ask questions and interact with the environment.

The referee tells the player characters what happens and when to roll dice.

To play, you will need these rules, at least one set of [polyhedral dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Polyhedral_dice) (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), paper, and pencils.

## Principles of Play

- **Rullings over rules**
- **Fiction over mechanics**
- **Information, choice, consequence**
- **Danger is obvious**
- **Fighting is deadly**
- **Keep it weird**
