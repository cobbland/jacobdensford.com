# The Fell

The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered by fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors. Cairns and barrows dot the landscape--memorials to heroes long dead and a time long forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake through the Fell, connecting sleepy villages and quiet towns, and leading down to the lands beyond--into the misty expanse and, beyond that, to the mountains smoking on the distant horizon.
