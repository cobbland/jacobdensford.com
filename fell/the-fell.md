# The Fell

The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered in fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors. Cairns and barrows dot the frigid landscape--memorials to heroes long dead and a time long forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake through the Fell, connecting silent villages and desolate towns, and leading down into the lands beyond--the misty expanse and the smoking mountains on the distant horizon.
