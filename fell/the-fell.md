# The Fell

The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered in fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors. Cairns and barrows dot the frigid landscape—memorials to heroes long dead and a time forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake through the Fell, connecting silent villages and desolate towns, and leading down into the lands beyond—into the misty expanse and beyond, to the smoking mountains on the distant horizon.
