# The Fell

The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered in fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors, with a dormant volcano rising from its heart. Cairns and barrows dot the frigid landscape—memorials to heroes long dead and a time forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake and shift through the Fell, connecting silent villages and desolate towns, and leading down into the lands beyond—into the misty expanse and towards the smoking mountains on the distant horizon.

## Time

A day in the Fell lasts twenty-four hours. A few times a year, a day has an extra hour called a "moon hour" (this is a misnomer, as the extra hour is used to bring the day back in line with the rising and setting of the sun, and has nothing to do with the moon). A regular week has seven days. A regular month has twenty-eight days, always starts on the first day of the week, and begins with the new moon. Occasional "moon days" appear between months to bring the months back in line with the cycle of the moon. A year has twelve months plus a few moon days. Seasons are sporadic and unpredictable, sometimes lasting days, other times lasting years or even decades. There are three factors that dictate the changing of the seasons: the orbit and tilt of the planet, the volcanic activity of the mountain ranges that surround the Fell, and the severity of the yearly meteor shower (how many impact the planet and how much dust is thrown up into the atmosphere). These seasonal factors are only loosely grasped by the regular denizens of the Fell.

## Religion

The Church of All-Saints is the official church of the Fell. Chapels to various saints are scattered about the land. In actuality, many in the Fell—especially the peasantry—practice various local religions, centered around faërie-beings or nether-beings. The Church strongly discourages these practices.
