# The Fell

The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered in fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors, with a dormant volcano rising from its heart. Cairns and barrows dot the frigid landscape—memorials to heroes long dead and a time forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake and shift through the Fell, connecting silent villages and desolate towns, and leading down to the coast, beyond which lies the misty expanse of the sea.

## Locations

## The Island of Eilvalor

The Fell and the Island of Eilvalor are one and the same. The entirety of the island makes up the Duchy of Fellweald, though the duchess's rule is weaker in parts far flung.

### The Duchy of Fellweald

The king is dead and has been for a century. The duchess, Lady Gwendolen Fellweald, rules the land from her seat before the empty throne in Castle Fell at the foot of the Agermount. She has appointed barons to govern the far reaches of the Fell and to collect taxes on her behalf.

### The Barony of Rotherbourne

Baron Rotherbourne governs to the west of Castle Fell from his seat in the Rotkeep.

### The Wealdwood

The Wealdwood is a dark, twisted, **Magical Forest** that dominates the Barony of Rotherbourne. It is home to many dangerous creatures that have been known to attack travelers who stray too far from the path. The borders between the faërie, daemon, and mortal realms are thin here, leading to occasional encounters with magical beings.

### The Barony of TKTK

TKTK

### The Barrowfields

These cold, dry fields stretch from the southernmost reaches of the Barony of Rotherbourne, extend down into the Barony of TKTK, and terminate at the coastal cliffs—the very edge of the Dutchy of Fellweald. As their name suggests, the Barrowfields are covered in ancient burrial mounds. Many believe that within some of these tombs lie secret passages into the **Mythic Underworld**.

## People

### Duchess Gwendolen Fellweald

### Baron Rotherbourne

### Baron TKTK

### His Holiness, the Bishop TKTK

## Beliefs

### Religion

The Church of All-Saints is the official church of the Fell. Chapels to various saints are scattered about the land. In actuality, many in the Fell—especially the peasantry—practice various local religions, centered around faërie-beings or daemon-beings. The Church strongly discourages these practices, both through its teachings and through force via its inquisitors.

### Holy Days

The full moon of each month falls on the holy day of the month's given Apostles of the First-Saint. Other All-Saint Days are scattered throughout each month, falling on the day of the week that best aligns with the Tenants of the All-Saints they were most known for.

## Time

It is important to track the passage of time throughout the course of a campaign.

Given the sporadic nature of the seasons in the Fell, the best way to mark their passage is to align them with the real life season you're playing during. That way, depending on how in-game time is passing, seasons can last a few weeks or a few years.

### Days

A day in the Fell lasts twenty-four hours.

### Weeks

A regular week has seven days. Each day of the week represents one of the Seven Tenants of the All-Saints.

- **Sunday:**
- **Monday:**
- **Tuesday:**
- **Wednesday:**
- **Thursday:**
- **Friday:**
- **Saturday:**

### Months

A month has twenty-eight days, always starts on the first day of the week, and begins with the new moon. Each month represents one of the Twelve Apostles of the First-Saint.

- **January:**
- **February:**
- **March:**
- **April:**
- **May:**
- **June:**
- **July:**
- **August:**
- **September:**
- **October:**
- **November:**
- **December:**

### Years

A year has twelve months plus a few moon days.

### Moon Hours and Days

A few times a year, a day has an extra hour called a "moon hour". (This is a misnomer, as the extra hour is used to bring the day back in line with the rising and setting of the sun, and has nothing to do with the moon.)

Occasional "moon days" appear between months to bring the months back in line with the cycle of the moon.

### Seasons

Seasons are sporadic and unpredictable, sometimes lasting days, other times lasting years or even decades. There are three factors that dictate the changing of the seasons: the orbit and tilt of the planet, the volcanic activity of the mountain ranges that surround the Fell, and the severity of the yearly meteor shower (how many impact the planet and how much dust is thrown up into the atmosphere). These seasonal factors seem shrouded in mystery to the regular denizens of the Fell. Even to the most learned, they are only loosely grasped.

## Travel

### Travel in a Day

There are four watches in a day. Each watch lasts six hours. PCs can travel for two watches each day, requiring one hour of rest each watch.

### Forced March

PCs can skip rest hours or march for additional watches, but doing so gives them a level of fatigue. This fatigue stacks. Removing fatigue requires a full night's rest for each level of fatigue.

### Rates of Travel

- **One and two thirds base travel rate (5 miles per hour, 50 miles per day):** major roads
- **One and one third base travel rate (4 miles per hour, 40 miles per day):** roads
- **Base travel rate (3 miles per hour, 30 miles per day):** trails, plains, meadows, farmland, gentle hills, sparse forest
- **Two thirds base travel rate (2 miles per hour, 20 miles per day):** forests, hills, deserts
- **One third base travel rate (1 mile per hour, ten miles per day):** swamps, jungles, dense forests, mountains

### Getting Lost

An INT test is required when attempting to move into a new hex during travel. On a failure, the PCs have gone astray. If the highest die resulted is a 3, they've veered one hex to the left or right; a 2, two hexes; a 1, three hexes or they've accidentally backtracked.

- **Advantage:** plains, meadows, farmland, gentle hills, sparse forest, previously traveled area
- **Disadvantage:** swamps, jungles, dense forests, mountains

No roll is required if the PCs are following a road or known trail, coastline, river, or treeline.
