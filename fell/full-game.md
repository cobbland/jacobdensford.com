*Fell* is a [tabletop roleplaying game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) for at least two players.

One player is the referee, playing the world and its inhabitants. They adjudicate the rules, make rulings, and describe the situations the player characters find themselves in.

The rest are player characters (PCs); acting as knaves, wretches, and scoundrels seeking fortune in a corrupted land filled with danger. They ask questions and interact with the environment.

The referee tells the player characters what happens and when to roll dice.

To play, you will need these rules, at least one set of [polyhedral dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Polyhedral_dice) (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), paper, and pencils.

## Principles of Play

- **Rullings over rules**
- **Fiction over mechanics**
- **Information, choice, consequence**
- **Danger is obvious**
- **Fighting is deadly**
- **Keep it weird**

# full-game

The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered in fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors. Cairns and barrows dot the frigid landscape--memorials to heroes long dead and a time long forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake through the Fell, connecting silent villages and desolate towns, and leading down into the lands beyond--the misty expanse and the smoking mountains on the distant horizon.

# Creating a Character

Give yourself a **[name](/fell/tables/#names)**.

Roll 2d20+10 for your **age**.

Optionally, roll or choose some **[traits](/fell/tables/#traits)**.

You have three **abilities**:

- **Body (BOD):** constitution, grit, strength, reflexes
- **Intellect (INT):** aim, cunning, intelligence, quick thinking
- **Willpower (WIL):** force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasiveness

Roll d8 for each **ability** in order to assign **ability dice** (AD) and gain **ability points** (AP) equal to each die's highest face. (Or assign d6 to each, optionally lowering one to d4 to gain a d8.)

d8|Ability Die
:--|--:
1-4|d4
5-6|d6
7-8|d8

Roll your ability dice and keep the highest single die result. Gain that many **hit points** (HP), representing your ability to avoid critical harm. (Or start with 4 HP.)

Roll or choose a **background** and gain the associated **skill** and **equipment**.

You have 4+BOD **equipment slots**.

You have a **steel die** granted by your weapon and a **skill die** equal to your INT.

If your WIL is d8, roll or choose one **[spell](/fell/tables/#spells)**, and gain a **spell die** of any size that you can change as often as you like.

# Playing the Game

## Tasks and Tests

Most of the time, you simply say what you do in response to the corrupted land and its inhabitants described by the referee. Any action you take is a **task**. With some tasks, rolling dice is unavoidable.

Whenever you attempt a task you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Collect dice: an ability die from your relevant ability and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one.

Roll, comparing your highest single die result to the **difficulty number** (DN), which is usually **4**. If you meet or exceed the difficulty number, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

**Tests are always dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.**

## Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you **advantage,** you may roll your dice one step higher. When a situation imposes **disadvantage**, you must roll your dice one step lower. Advantages and disadvantages stack and cancel each other out one for one.

## Dice Ladder

When a rule or the referee instructs you to roll your dice a number of steps higher or lower, move up or down the rungs of the **dice ladder**:

**d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12**

If a die would be lowered below a d4, you cannot roll it. If it would be raised above a d12, add a bonus die that begins at the bottom of the ladder.

## Help

When someone else attempts a task and it makes sense for you to do so, you may **help**. If it's a test, roll an applicable steel, skill, or spell die to be included. If they fail, trouble is coming for you as well.

## Contests

When you attempt a task and someone else opposes you, it's a **contest**. You each collect dice as normal for a test, then roll. Whoever has the highest single die result wins. In a tie, a die higher up the ladder beats a lower one.

## Turns and Rounds

Time is tracked in **turns** and **rounds**. During a round, everyone takes a turn.

During an **encounter**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a task and traverse a room—about ten seconds. Player characters act first and as a group, taking their turns together. When surprised, roll an INT contest to determine if you can act during the first round.

While **exploring**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a few tasks and investigate an area, or to rest—about ten minutes.

When **traveling**, a round lasts long enough to traverse three miles of easy terrain at a steady pace—about one hour.

## Hirelings

**Hirelings** are nonplayer characters (NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings are created just like player characters with two exceptions: they have d4 in each ability and must roll for HP. When performing a relevant task, your hirelings may help just as another player character would.

Hirelings cost 5 coin per day. You may pay 5 additional coin per day to employ a hireling with a higher ability die. If not paid upfront, you must roll a WIL contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

You may employ a number of hirelings equal to your WIL.

## Spells

To cast a **spell**, either one you've learned or from a scroll, you must roll a WIL test using your spell die.

Whenever using your spell die, if its result is higher than the result of the test's ability die, take the difference as harm, first to HP, then to WIL. If WIL harm is taken in this way and a scroll was used, the scroll is destroyed.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce its effects.

It takes a week and components worth 100 coin to learn a new spell from a scroll or wizened teacher. You can know a number of spells equal to your WIL.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC whose disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL on the table below to determine their **reaction**.

Roll|Reaction
:--|--:
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

## Leverage

If you have **leverage** and apply it, you may improve an NPC's reaction by winning a WIL contest.

## Attacking

Attacking is a task for which you do not have to make a test. To **attack**, roll your weapon's steal die and subtract your opponents protection. Deal what's left as harm—first to hit points, then to BOD.

When more than one person attacks a single target or when attacking with multiple weapons, roll all steel dice and use the highest single die result.

## Critical Harm

When you take harm to your ability points, it is **critical harm**. Roll a test with that ability. The difficulty number is equal to the amount of critical harm taken. If you fail, you must roll on the death table.

## Blast

**Blast** causes harm to multiple targets in close proximity, rolling separately for each. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll the weapon's steel die.

## Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP by half, roll a WIL contest. If you win, roll your WILL on the **morale** table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|--:
1-3|Hesitate
4-5|Retreat
6-7|Flee
8-9|Surender Conditionally
10-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain hit points or ability points, nor can you restore ability dice.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

You may remove one level of fatigue for each night of comfortable rest on a full stomach.

## Harm and Death

**Harm** subtracts from hit points, then ability points.

In some cases, critical harm may reduce an ability's die.

When you fail a critical harm test, roll that ability on the **death** table.

Roll|Death
:--|--:
1-3|Dead
4-5|Dead in d4 rounds unless treated
6-7|Unconcious for d4 hours unless revived
8-9|Hurt but still standing
10-12|Recover d4 HP

When an ability's points reach zero or an ability's die would be lowered below d4, you die.

## Healing and Rest

**Healing** recovers hit points and ability points, and restores ability dice.

Whenever you take several minutes to **rest**, recover all your hit points. When you rest for the night, recover all your ability points. After a full week of rest and appropriate care, restore all your reduced ability dice.

## Advancement

Each time you return to relative safety bearing significant plunder gained through deadly peril, you may attempt to **advance**.

Roll all your ability dice.

For each die that rolls higher than your current hit points, gain one hit point.

For each die that rolls its highest number, increase that ability's die by one step.

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

Most items use 1 equipment slot. **Bulky** items use 2 slots and generally require two hands to carry or wield. Small equipment can be bundled together to only use 1 slot. For example, three days' rations only uses one slot. 100 coins uses 1 slot; fewer coins fit in your pockets and don't use a slot.

# Running the Game

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the player characters is uncertain, roll a **luck die**--usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Roll a luck die:

- When the player characters stop to rest in a dangerous location
- When a player character fails a test
- If a player character makes a loud noise in a dungeon
- After each round of dungeon exploration and wilderness navigation
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Time

One way to track time while traveling, exploring, or during an encounter is to use a d6. Start the d6 with the "one" side facing up. After each round, flip the die to the next highest side. After you've cycled through the whole die, check for rest, food, light sources, etc. Then begin again.

During an encounter, one full die represents a minute.

While exploring, one full die represents an hour.

When traveling, one full die represents six hours.

## Difficulty

When the standard difficulty number of 4 doesn't suffice, which it usually should, consult the difficulty table below for guidance.

DN|Difficulty
:--|--:
0|Very easy
2|Easy
**4** | **Normal**
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

## Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one passed test to accomplish. Tell how many the **extended test** will require, then player characters roll as normal. They may repeat the roll to add additional passes once they've dealt with any trouble.

## Protection

Protection should never, or very rarely, be increased beyond 3.

## Nonplayer Characters

**Nonplayer Characters** (or NPCs) can be townsfolk, hirelings, monsters, or anything in between.

All NPCs should have a **name**, a flavorful **description**, and a **drive**.

NPCs default to having d4 in each ability and 3 HP. If an NPC is meant to be exceptionally easy to overcome, lower their HP. If they're competent, give them d6s and 5 HP. If they're particularly strong, smart, or magical; raise that ability's die to d8, or even higher, and bump their HP up by 1 or 2. If what they're good at is more specific, give them a skill. If they're tough, give them armor. If they're quick, give them more HP.

## Optional Rules

All rules are optional. These, especially so.

### Customizing Backgrounds

Players may create their own backgrounds, gaining one skill of their choice and purchasing equipment worth 60 coin.

### Longer Dice Ladder

If you have access to wacky dice or a digital dice roller, you may want to add some extra rungs to the dice ladder. For example, if using dice from [DCC](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/), the ladder would look like this:

**d3 → d4 → d5 → d6 → d7 → d8 → d10 → d12 → etc**

## Converting OSR Material

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to three OSR abilities, but it's not an exact conversion.

Fell|OSR
:--|--:
Body|Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Intellect|Intelligence, Dexterity, Wisdom
Willpower|Wisdom, Charisma, Intelligence

### Ability Dice and Hit Points

Use the table below for guidance.

OSR HD|Fell AD and HP
:--|--:
1|d4 2HP
2|d4 3HP
3|d6 4HP
4|d6 5HP
5|d8 6HP
6|d8 7HP
7|d10 8HP
8|d10 9HP
9|d12 10HP
10|d12 11HP
11+|d12+ 12HP+

### Damage

Typically, use the damage die as the steel die. Sometimes, step the die down one if it feels like too much. If the damage would be significantly more than a d12, roll twice and take the higher result.

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists should work with *Fell*, such as the [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

If a spell causes harm, follow the damage guidelines above.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

If the spell uses levels, the spell's level is the difficulty number for the test that must be rolled to cast the spell.
