# Playing the Game

Most of the time, you will simply say what you do in response to the corrupted land and its inhabitants described by the facilitator. Sometimes, you will roll dice.

## Tests

Whenever you attempt a task that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn how hard it will be and what could go wrong, then roll a test.

Collect dice: An ability die from your relevant ability and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one.

Roll, comparing each die individually to the difficulty number (or DN). A die that meets or exceeds the difficulty number counts as a hit.

DN|Difficulty
:--|:--
0|Very easy
2|Easy
4|Moderate
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

If you roll the highest number on a die, you may reroll it with the next die up.

The test passes if you roll at least one hit.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you advantage, you may roll your dice one step higher.

When a situation imposes disadvantage, you must roll your dice one step lower.

### Help

When someone else makes a test, you may roll a relevant steel, skill, or spell die and add your hit to their test.

### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll. Compare dice individually, highest to lowest. Higher numbers beat lower and count as hits. In a tie, bigger dice beat smaller.

### Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one hit to accomplish.

## Hirelings

Hirelings are nonplayer characters (or NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings have d4 hit die (or HD) with 4 hit points (or HP), one skill, and 8 equipment slots (4+HD). When performing a relevant test, you may add your hireling's skill die to your roll.

Hirelings cost 5 coin per day. You may pay 5 additional coin per day to employ a hireling with a higher HD or an additional skill. If not paid upfront, you must roll a contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC who's disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL ability die on the table below to determine their reaction.

Roll|Reaction
:--|:--
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

If you have leverage, you can modify an NPC's reaction by rolling a contest, improving their disposition with every hit.

## Combat

Combat involves a series of rounds made up of turns. A round lasts long enough for everyone to make a test and traverse a room--about six seconds.

Each side acts as a group, taking their turns together. When it isn't obvious, roll a contest to determine which side takes their turns first.

During your turn, you may move and make a test, often an attack. Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins deals each hit as harm.

## Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP by half, roll a contest. If you win, roll your WILL ability die on the morale table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|:--
1-3|Retreat
4-5|Flee
6-7|Surender Conditionally
8-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are deprived of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain ability points.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become fatigued and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

## Harm and Death

Harm subtracts points from an ability.

In rare cases, extreme harm reduces an ability's die.

When an ability's points are reduced to 0 or its die reduced below a d4, roll on the death table.

d4|Death
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d4 hours unless treated
4|Dead in 1d4 days unless treated

## Healing and Rest

Healing recovers ability points.

Whenever you take a few minutes to rest and eat or drink, leaving yourself exposed, you may roll an ability die and recover that many points. When you rest for the night on a full stomach, you may recover all your points.

After a full week of comfortable rest and hearty meals, you may restore a reduced ability die to normal.
