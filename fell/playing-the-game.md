# Playing the Game

Most of the time, you will simply say what you do in response to the corrupted land and its inhabitants described by the facilitator. Sometimes, you will roll dice.

## Abilities

You have three **abilities**:

- **Body (BOD):** Constitution, grit, reflexes, strength
- **Intellect (INT):** Aim, cunning, intelligence, perception
- **Willpower (WIL):** Force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasiveness

Each has an **ability die** (or AD) ranging from d4 to d12.

Each also has **ability points** (or AP) equal to the highest number on the ability's die.

## Skills

If you have any **skills**, you gain a **skill die** (or SD) equal to your INT ability die.

You may roll your skill die whenever you perform a test using your skills.

When you gain an undefined skill, roll on the skill table to determine which one.

8|survival

## Spells

If you have any **spells**, you gain a **spell die** (or SD) of any size, which you can change as often as you'd like.

You must roll a test to cast a spell. You may roll your spell die as part of the test, subtracting its result from your WIL.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce the effects.

When you gain an undefined spell, roll on the spell table to determine which one.

## Equipment

You have 4+BOD **equipment slots** (or slots).

Weapons grant a **steel die** (or SD). Whenever you make a test with a weapon, you may add its steel die to your roll.

**Harm** reduces your target's ability points.

**Bulky** equipment uses 2 slots and generally requires two hands to carry or wield.

**Blast** harm applies to multiple targets in close proximity. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll the weapon's steel die.

Armor grants **protection** from harm in the form of **protection points** (or PP). Instead of taking harm to your ability, you may choose to take it to your protection. Once out of protection, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.

Unless otherwise noted, items use one slot, harm is dealt to one target's BOD, and protection only applies to BOD.

## Hirelings

**Hirelings** are nonplayer characters (or NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings have d4 hit die (or HD) with 4 hit points (or HP), one skill, and 8 equipment slots (4+HD). When performing a relevant test, you may add your hireling's skill die to your roll.

Hirelings cost 5 coin per day. You may pay 5 additional coin per day to employ a hireling with a higher HD or an additional skill. If not paid upfront, you must roll a contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

## Tests

Whenever you attempt a **task** that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn how hard it will be and what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Collect dice: An ability die from your relevant ability and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one.

Roll, comparing each die individually to the **difficulty number** (or DN). A die that meets or exceeds the difficulty number counts as a **hit**.

DN|Difficulty
:--|:--
0|Very easy
2|Easy
4|Moderate
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

If you roll the highest number on a die, you may reroll it with the next die up.

The test passes if you roll at least one hit.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you **advantage,** you may roll your dice one step higher.

When a situation imposes **disadvantage**, you must roll your dice one step lower.

### Help

When someone else makes a test, you may roll a relevant steel, skill, or spell die and add your hit to their test as **help**.

### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll a **contest**. Compare dice individually, highest to lowest. Higher numbers beat lower and count as hits. In a tie, bigger dice beat smaller.

### Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one hit to accomplish. Learn how many hits the **extended test** will require, collect dice as normal, and roll. You may repeat the roll to add additional hits once you've dealt with any trouble.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC who's disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL ability die on the table below to determine their **reaction**.

Roll|Reaction
:--|:--
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

### Leverage

If you have **leverage**, you can modify an NPC's reaction by rolling a contest, improving their disposition with every hit.

## Combat

**Combat** involves a series of **rounds** made up of **turns**. A round lasts long enough for everyone to make a test and traverse a room--about six seconds.

### Turns

Each side acts as a group, taking their turns together. When it isn't obvious, roll a contest to determine which side takes their turns first.

### Attacking

During your turn, you may move and make a test, often an **attack**. Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins deals each hit as harm.

### Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP by half, roll a contest. If you win, roll your WILL ability die on the **morale** table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|:--
1-3|Retreat
4-5|Flee
6-7|Surender Conditionally
8-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain ability points.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

## Harm and Death

**Harm** subtracts points from an ability.

In rare cases, extreme harm reduces an ability's die.

When an ability's points are reduced to 0 or its die reduced below a d4, roll on the **death** table.

d4|Death
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d4 hours unless treated
4|Dead in 1d4 days unless treated

## Healing and Rest

**Healing** recovers ability points.

Whenever you take a few minutes to **rest** and eat or drink, leaving yourself exposed, you may roll an ability die and recover that many points. When you rest for the night on a full stomach, you may recover all your points.

After a full week of comfortable rest and hearty meals, you may restore a reduced ability die to normal.

## Character Advancement

Each time you return to relative safety after a dangerous encounter, you may attempt to **advance**.

Roll each ability's die. Increase the die by one if you roll its highest number. Reduce it if you roll its lowest.

Instead of increasing your INT die, you may gain a new skill.

Instead of increasing your WIL die, you may gain a new spell.
