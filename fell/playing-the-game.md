# Playing the Game

Most of the time, you will use your wits and simply say what you do in response to the corrupted land and its inhabitants described by the facilitator. Sometimes, rolling dice is unavoidable.

## Tests

Whenever you attempt a **task** that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn how hard it will be and what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Collect up to three dice: an ability die from your relevant ability; an applicable steel, skill, or spell die; and a bonus die if you have one for the given task.

Roll, comparing each die individually to the **difficulty number** (or DN). A die that meets or exceeds the difficulty number counts as a **hit**.

DN|Difficulty
:--|--:
0|Very easy
2|Easy
4|Moderate
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

If you roll the highest number on a die, you may reroll it with the next die up.

The test passes if you roll at least one hit.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

**Tests are always dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.**

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you **advantage,** you may roll your dice one step higher.

When a situation imposes **disadvantage**, you must roll your dice one step lower. If this would reduce a die below d4, you simply cannot roll it.

Advantages and disadvantages stack and cancel each other out one for one.

### Help

When someone else makes a test and it makes sense for you to do so, you may **help**. Roll a steel, skill, or spell die. If you hit, add your hit to their test. If you miss and they fail their test, trouble is coming for you as well.

### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll a **contest**. Compare dice individually, highest to lowest. Higher numbers beat lower and count as hits. In a tie, bigger dice beat smaller. Uncontested dice hit. Whoever has the most hits wins the contest.

### Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one hit to accomplish. Learn how many hits the **extended test** will require, collect dice as normal, and roll. You may repeat the roll to add additional hits once you've dealt with any trouble.

## Turns and Rounds

Time is tracked in *turns* and *rounds*. During a round, everyone takes a turn.

Player characters act as a group, taking their turns together.

When it isn't obvious and multiple sides are involved, roll a contest to determine which side takes their turns first.

During an encounter, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a task and traverse a room--about ten seconds.

When exploring a dungeon, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a few tasks and investigate an area--about ten minutes.

When navigating the wilderness, a round lasts long enough to travel three miles at a steady pace--about one hour.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC who's disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL ability die on the table below to determine their **reaction**.

Roll|Reaction
:--|--:
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

### Leverage

If you have **leverage**, you can modify an NPC's reaction by rolling a contest, improving their disposition with every hit.

## Attacking

An **attack** is a special kind of contest that no one really wins. For each hit, deal your die's result as harm. For each miss, take your opponent's die's result as harm.

Most of the time, it is advantageous to attack together against a single opponent. In such a case, one player character leads the contest, rolling as normal. Everyone else helps, counting it as their action. Misses deal harm to whoever's die missed. Uncontested misses deal harm to whoever leads the contest.

### Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP by half, roll a WIL contest. If you win, roll your WILL ability die on the **morale** table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|--:
1-3|Retreat
4-5|Flee
6-7|Surender Conditionally
8-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain ability points.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

You may remove one level of fatigue for each night of comfortable rest on a full stomach.

## Harm and Death

**Harm** subtracts points from an ability.

In rare cases, extreme harm reduces an ability's die.

When an ability's points are reduced to 0, roll on the **death** table.

d4|Death
:--|--:
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d4 hours unless treated
4|Dead in 1d4 days unless treated

When an ability's die would be reduced below d4 from harm, you die.

## Healing and Rest

**Healing** recovers ability points.

Whenever you take a few minutes to **rest** and eat or drink, you may roll each ability die and recover that many points in the corresponding ability. When you comfortably rest for the night on a full stomach, you may recover all your points.

After a full week of comfortable rest and hearty meals, you may restore a reduced ability die by one level.

## Character Advancement

Each time you return to relative safety bearing treasure gained through peril, you may attempt to **advance**.

Roll each ability's die. Increase the die by one if you roll its highest number. Reduce it if you roll its lowest.

Instead of increasing your INT die, you may roll it again, gaining a skill if the result of the roll is higher than your current number of skills.

Instead of increasing your WIL die, you may roll it again, gaining a spell if the result of the roll is higher than your current number of spells.
