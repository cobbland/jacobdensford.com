# Playing the Game

Most of the time, you simply say what you do in response to the corrupted land and its inhabitants described by the facilitator. Sometimes, rolling dice is unavoidable.

## Tests

Whenever you attempt a **task** that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn how hard it will be and what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Collect dice: an ability die from your relevant ability and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one.

Roll, comparing each die individually to the **difficulty number** (or DN), which is usually 4. A die that meets or exceeds the difficulty number counts as a **hit**.

DN|Difficulty
:--|--:
0|Very easy
2|Easy
**4** | **Normal**
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

The test passes if you roll at least one hit.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

**Tests are always dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.**

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you **advantage,** you may roll your dice one step higher. If this would increase a die above d12, it counts as a hit.

When a situation imposes **disadvantage**, you must roll your dice one step lower. If this would reduce a die below d4, it counts as a miss.

Advantages and disadvantages stack and cancel each other out one for one.

### Help

When someone else attempts a test and it makes sense for you to do so, you may **help**. Roll an applicable steel, skill, or spell die and add it to their test. If they fail their test, trouble is coming for you as well.

### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll a **contest**. Whoever has the highest single die roll wins. In a tie, a bigger die beats a smaller one.

### Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one hit to accomplish. Learn how many hits the **extended test** will require, collect dice as normal, and roll. You may repeat the roll to add additional hits once you've dealt with any trouble.

## Turns and Rounds

Time is tracked in **turns** and **rounds**. During a round, everyone takes a turn.

During an **encounter**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a task and traverse a room--about ten seconds.

Player characters act first and as a group, taking their turns together.

When surprised, roll an INT contest to determine if you can act during the first round.

While **exploring**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a few tasks and investigate an area, or to rest--about ten minutes.

When **traveling**, a round lasts long enough to traverse three miles of easy terrain at a steady pace--about one hour.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC who's disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL ability die on the table below to determine their **reaction**.

Roll|Reaction
:--|--:
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

### Leverage

If you have **leverage** and apply it, you may modify an NPC's reaction by rolling a WIL contest, improving their disposition with every hit.

## Attacking

To **attack**, roll your weapon's steal die and subtract your opponents protection. Deal what's left as harm--first to hit points, then to BOD ability points.

When more than one person attacks a single target or when attacking with multiple weapons, roll all steel dice and use the highest result.

### Critical Harm

When you take harm to your ability points, it is **critical harm**. Roll a test with that ability's die. The difficulty number is equal to the amount of harm taken. If you fail, you must roll on the death table.

### Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP by half, roll a WIL contest. If you win, roll your WILL ability die on the **morale** table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|--:
1-3|Retreat
4-5|Flee
6-7|Surender Conditionally
8-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain hit points or ability points, nor can you restore ability dice.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

You may remove one level of fatigue for each night of comfortable rest on a full stomach.

## Harm and Death

**Harm** subtracts from hit points and then ability points.

In rare cases, extreme harm reduces an ability's die.

When you fail a critical harm test, roll that ability's die on the **death** table.

Roll|Death
:--|--:
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Unconcious for 1d4 hours unlessed revived
4+|Hurt but still standing

When an ability's points reach zero or an ability's die would be reduced below d4, you die.

## Healing and Rest

**Healing** recovers hit points and ability points and restores ability dice.

Whenever you take a few minutes to **rest**, roll your highest ability die and recover that many hit points. When you rest for the night, recover all your hit points and ability points. After a full week of rest and appropriate care, restore all your reduced ability dice.

## Character Advancement

Each time you return to relative safety bearing plunder gained through peril, you may attempt to **advance**.

Roll all your ability dice.

For each die that rolls higher than your current hit points, gain one hit point.

For each die that rolls its highest number, increase the ability's die by one step.

Instead of increasing your INT die, you may gain a skill if the result of the roll was higher than your current number of skills.

Instead of increasing your WIL die, you may gain a spell if the result of the roll was higher than your current number of spells.
