# Playing the Game

## Tasks and Tests

Most of the time, you simply say what you do and find out what happens. But whenever you attempt a **task** where the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Collect dice: an ability die from your relevant ability and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one.

Roll, comparing your highest single die result to the **difficulty number** (DN), which is usually **4**. If you meet or exceed the difficulty number, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

**Tests are always dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.**

## Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you **advantage,** you may roll your dice one step higher. When a situation imposes **disadvantage**, you must roll your dice one step lower. Advantages and disadvantages stack and cancel each other out one for one.

## Dice Ladder

When a rule or the referee instructs you to raise or lower your dice a number of steps higher or lower, move up or down the rungs of the **dice ladder**:

**d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12**

If a die would be lowered below a d4, you cannot roll it. If it would be raised above a d12, add a bonus die that begins at the bottom of the ladder.

## Help

When someone else attempts a task and it makes sense for you to do so, you may **help**. If it's a test, roll an applicable steel, skill, or spell die to be included. If they fail, trouble is coming for you as well.

## Contests

When you attempt a task and someone else opposes you, it's a **contest**. You each collect dice as normal for a test, then roll. Whoever has the highest single die result wins. In a tie, a die higher up the ladder beats a lower one, then more dice beat fewer, then compare the next highest dice.

## Skills

When you roll a test using your **skills**, include your skill die. If any of your skills overlap, roll with advantage.

Whenever you roll a test to attempt a task that someone with your background would reasonably be good at, you may add it as an additional skill.

It takes a week and tools worth 100 GP to learn a new skill not from your background. You can know a number of skills equal to your INT.

## Spells

To cast a **spell**, either one you've learned or from a magical object, you must roll a WIL test using your spell die.

Whenever using your spell die, if its result is higher than the result of the test's ability die, take the difference as harm, first to hit points, then to WIL. Instead of taking this harm, you may permanently forget the spell or allow the magical object to be destroyed.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce its effects.

It takes a week and components worth 100 GP to learn a new spell. You can know a number of spells equal to your WIL.

## Equipment and Slots

When carrying more than your equipment slots, you have disadvantage. You can never carry more than twice your slots.

Most items use 1 slot. **Bulky** items use 2 slots and generally require two hands to carry or wield.

Small equipment can be bundled together to only use 1 slot. For example, three torches or enough rations for three days each only use one slot. 100 coins (CP, SP, or GP) use 1 slot; fewer coins fit in your pockets and don't use a slot.

## Turns and Rounds

Time is tracked in **turns** and **rounds**. During a round, everyone takes a turn.

During an **encounter**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a task and traverse a room—about ten seconds. PCs act first and as a group, taking their turns together. When surprised, roll an INT contest to determine if you can act during the first round.

While **exploring**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a few tasks and investigate an area, or to rest—about ten minutes.

When **traveling**, a round lasts long enough to traverse three miles of easy terrain at a steady pace—about one hour.

## Hirelings

**Hirelings** are non-protagonist characters (NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings are created just like PCs. When performing a relevant task, your hirelings may help just as another PC would.

Hirelings take an equal share of any plunder, minus their upfront fee of 5 GP per day. If this fee is not paid in advance, you must roll a WIL contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

You can employ a number of hirelings equal to your WIL.

## Detachments

Groups of similar NPCs acting together are treated as a single **detachment**. Their attacks have advantage against individuals and have blast. Attacks against them made by individuals have disadvantage unless they have blast.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC whose disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL on the table below to determine their **reaction**.

Roll|Reaction
:--|--:
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

## Leverage

If you have **leverage** and apply it, you may improve an NPC's reaction by winning a WIL contest.

## Attacks

Attacking is a task that does not require a test. To **attack**, roll your weapon's steal die and subtract your opponents protection. Deal what's left as harm—first to hit points, then to BOD.

When more than one person attacks a single target or when attacking with multiple weapons, roll all steel dice and use the highest single die result.

## Protection

**Protection** subtracts from harm to hit points and BOD.

## Blast

**Blast** causes harm to multiple targets in close proximity, rolling separately for each. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll the weapon's steel die.

## Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies hit points by half, roll a WIL contest. If you win, roll your WILL on the **morale** table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|--:
1-3|Hesitate
4-5|Retreat
6-7|Flee
8-9|Surender Conditionally
10-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain hit points or ability points, nor can you restore ability dice.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

You may remove one level of fatigue for each night of comfortable rest on a full stomach.

## Harm and Death

**Harm** subtracts from hit points. Once out of hit points, harm becomes **critical harm** and subtracts from ability points.

When you take critical harm, roll a test with that ability. The difficulty number is equal to the amount of critical harm taken. If you fail, you are subjected to your opponent's critical harm effect, taken out of the fight, and may die unless treated.

When an ability's points reach zero or an ability's die would be lowered below d4, you are **dead**.

## Healing and Rest

**Healing** recovers hit points and ability points, and restores ability dice.

Whenever you take several minutes to **rest**, recover all your hit points. When you rest for the night, recover all your ability points. After a full week of rest and appropriate care, restore all your reduced ability dice.

## Advancement

Each time you return to relative safety bearing significant plunder gained through deadly peril, you may attempt to **advance**.

Roll all your ability dice.

For each die that rolls equal to or higher than your current hit points, gain one hit point.

For each die that rolls its highest number, gain one hit point and raise that ability's die by one step.

Once your hit points reach 24 and your ability dice are d12s, retire to safety. Or keep seeking fortune and become a legend.
