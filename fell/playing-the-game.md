# Playing the Game

Most of the time, you will simply say what you do in response to the corrupted land and its inhabitants described by the facilitator. Sometimes, you will roll dice.

## Tests

Whenever you attempt to do something that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn what could go wrong and roll a *test*.

Collect dice: An attribute die from your relevant attribute and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one. If you're spending experience points, you may also roll your experience die.

Roll, comparing each die individually to the table below.

Roll|Result
:--|:--
1-3|Miss
4-5|Weak Hit
6+|Hit

The test passes if you roll at least one *hit*. (Rarely, especially difficult tests might require two or more hits.)

If your highest die is a *weak hit*, you only partially succeed or there are unforeseen consequences.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails and there is trouble.

You may choose to accept extra trouble in exchange for passing a failed test. You will be told what that trouble will be before deciding.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you *advantage*, you may roll your dice one step higher.

When a situation imposes *disadvantage*, you must roll your dice one step lower.

### Help

When someone else makes a test, you may roll a relevant steel, skill, or spell die and add your hit to their test.

### Group Tests

When it makes sense to perform a test as a group, everyone rolls as normal and combines their results.

### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. In a tie, hits beat weak hits, higher numbers beat lower, then bigger dice beat smaller.

## Hirelings

Hirelings are *nonplayer characters* (or NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings have d4 *hit die* (or HD) with 4 *hit points* (or HP), d4 in one skill, and 8 equipment slots (4+HD). When performing a relevant test, you may add your hireling's skill die to your roll.

Hirelings cost 5 coin per day. You may pay 5 additional coin per day to employ a hireling with a higher HD or SD, or an additional skill. If not paid upfront, you must roll a contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC who's disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL attribute die on the table below to determine their reaction.

Roll|Reaction
:--|:--
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-11|Helpful
12|Allied

If you have leverage, you can modify an NPC's reaction by rolling a contest, improving their disposition with every hit.

## Combat

Combat involves a series of *rounds* made up of *turns*. A round lasts long enough for everyone to make a test and traverse a room--about six seconds.

Each side acts as a group, taking their turns together. When it isn't obvious, roll a contest to determine which side takes their turns first.

During your turn, you may move and make a test, often an attack. Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins deals each hit as harm.

## Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP by half, roll a contest. If you win, roll your WILL attribute die on the morale table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|:--
1-3|Retreat
4-5|Flee
6-7|Surender Conditionally
8-12|Surender Unconditionally

## Deprived and Fatigued

When you are *deprived* of a crucial need--be it food, water, warmth, or sleep--you cannot regain attribute points.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become *fatigued* and must make all tests with disadvantage.

## Harm and Death

*Harm* subtracts points from an attribute.

When an attribute's points are reduced below the highest face on its die, reduce the die. Once reduced below a d4, tests can no longer be made using the attribute.

When an attribute's points are reduced to 0, roll on the death table.

Roll|Death Result
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d4 hours unless treated
4|Dead in 1d4 days unless treated

## Healing and Rest

*Healing* recovers attribute points.

When an attribute's points are increased to the highest face on a die, increase its die.

Whenever you take a few minutes to *rest* and eat or drink, you may recover points by succeeding on a test with the corresponding attribute. When you rest for the night on a full stomach, the test automatically succeeds.
