# Playing the Game

## Tasks and Tests

Most of the time, you simply say what you do and find out what happens. But whenever you attempt a **task** where the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Collect dice: one from your relevant attribute and an applicable steel, skill, or spell die if you have one.

Roll, comparing your highest single die result to the **difficulty number** (DN), which is usually **4**. If you meet or exceed the difficulty number, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.

## Extended Tests

Some risky tasks require more time and effort, and thus require more than one passed test to accomplish. Learn how many the **extended test** will require, then collect dice and roll as normal. You may repeat the roll to add additional passes once you've dealt with any trouble.

## Help

When someone else attempts a task and it makes sense for you to do so, you may **help**. If it's a test, roll an applicable steel, skill, or spell die to be included. If they fail, trouble is coming for you as well.

## Contests

When you attempt a task and someone else opposes you, it's a **contest**. You each collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the highest single die result wins. In a tie, a die higher up the ladder beats a lower one, then more dice beat fewer, then compare the next highest dice.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

When a situation grants you **advantage** (↑), you may roll your dice one step higher. When a situation imposes **disadvantage** (↓), you must roll your dice one step lower. Advantages and disadvantages stack and cancel each other out one for one.

## Dice Ladder

When a rule or the referee instructs you to raise or lower your dice a number of steps higher or lower, move up or down the rungs of the **dice ladder**:

**d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12**

If a die would be lowered below a d4, you cannot roll it. If it would be raised above a d12, add a bonus die that begins at the bottom of the ladder.

## Rounding Down

Unless otherwise specified or it would drop a number below one, always **round down**.

## Skills

When you roll a test using your **skills**, include a skill die equal to your INT. If any of your skills overlap, roll it with advantage.

Whenever you roll a test to attempt a task that someone with your background would reasonably be good at, you may add it as an additional skill.

It takes a month and tools worth 1,000 coin to learn a new skill not from your background. You can know a number of skills equal to your INT.

## Spells

When you spend several uninterrupted minutes in concentration, you may simply cast a **spell**. But to cast a spell in a hurry or when under threat, you must roll a WIL test with your spell die.

Each day, your spell die starts equal to your WIL. Each time you fail a test to cast a spell, lower your spell die one step. When it would be lowered below d4, you must wait until dawn to cast spells in this way again.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce its effects.

It takes a month and components worth 1,000 coin to learn a new spell. You can know a number of spells equal to your WIL.

## Item Slots

You have twice your STR in **item slots**. When carrying more, you have disadvantage. You can never carry more than double your slots. Smaller items can be bundled together. Every hundred coins-worth of treasure and coins fills one slot. **Bulky** items fill two slots and generally require two hands to carry or wield.

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to you is uncertain, the referee will roll a **luck die**—usually a d6. Higher is better. Lower is worse.

A luck die may be rolled...

- When you stop to rest in a dangerous location
- If you make a loud noise in a dungeon
- At the start of each exploration and travel round
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Detachments

Groups of similar NPCs acting together are treated as a single **detachment**. Their attacks have advantage against individuals and have blast. Attacks against them made by individuals have disadvantage unless they have blast.

## Turns and Rounds

Time is tracked in **turns** and **rounds**. During a round, everyone takes a turn.

During an **encounter**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a task and traverse a room—about ten seconds. PCs act first and as a group, taking their turns together. When surprised, roll a DEX contest to determine if you can act during the first round.

While **exploring**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a few tasks and investigate an area, to cast a spell, or to rest—about ten minutes.

When **traveling**, a round lasts long enough to traverse three miles of easy terrain at a steady pace—about one hour.

## Hirelings

**Hirelings** are non-protagonist characters (NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings are created just like PCs. When performing a relevant task, your hirelings may help just as another PC would.

Hirelings take an equal share of any plunder, minus their upfront daily fee. If this fee is not paid in advance, you must roll a WIL contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

You can employ a number of hirelings equal to your WIL.

## Reactions

When you encounter an NPC whose disposition towards you is not obvious, roll your WIL on the table below to determine their **reaction**.

Roll|Reaction
:--|--:
1-3|Hostile
4-5|Wary
6-7|Indifferent
8-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

## Leverage

If you have **leverage** and apply it, you may improve an NPC's reaction by winning a WIL contest.

## Attacks

To **attack**, roll your weapon's steel die and subtract your opponents armor. Deal what's left as harm—first to HP, then to STR.

When more than one person attacks a single target or when attacking with multiple weapons, roll all dice and use the highest single die result.

## Armor

**Armor** (A) subtracts from harm to HP and can never be increased beyond 3.

## Blast

**Blast** causes harm to multiple targets in close proximity, rolling separately for each. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll the weapon's steel die.

## Morale

When you defeat the first enemy or an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies HP to zero, roll a WIL contest. If you win, roll your WIL on the **morale** table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|--:
1-3|Hesitate
4-5|Retreat
6-7|Flee
8-9|Surrender Conditionally
10-12|Surrender Unconditionally

## Deprivation and Fatigue

When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain HP or restore attributes.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and must make all tests with disadvantage. Each additional day you are deprived makes the disadvantage worse.

You may remove one level of fatigue for each night of comfortable rest on a full stomach.

## Harm and Death

**Harm** subtracts from HP. Once out of HP, harm becomes **critical harm** and may lower a relevant attribute.

When you take critical harm, roll a test with the affected attribute. If you fail, lower the attribute one step—you’re taken out of the fight and will die without treatment.

When an attribute would be lowered below d4 from critical harm, you are **dead**.

## Healing and Rest

**Healing** recovers HP and restores attributes.

Whenever you take several minutes to **rest**, recover all your HP. After a full week of rest and appropriate care, raise a lowered attribute by one step.

## Advancement

When you return to relative safety bearing significant plunder gained through deadly peril, it may be possible to **advance**. If your hoard is worth...

- 1,000 C, gain HP and raise one attribute (novice)
- 3,000 C, gain HP (professional)
- 6,000 C, raise one attribute (expert)
- 10,000 C, gain HP (veteran)
- 15,000 C, raise one attribute (master)
- 21,000 C, gain HP and raise one attribute; fulfill your drive and retire to safety—or keep seeking fortune at your own peril (legend)
