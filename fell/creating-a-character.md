# Creating a Character

Give yourself a **[name](/fell/tables/#names)**.

Roll 2d20+10 for your **age**.

Optionally, roll or choose some **[traits](/fell/tables/#traits)**.

You have three **abilities**:

- **Body (BOD):** constitution, grit, strength, reflexes
- **Intellect (INT):** aim, cunning, intelligence, quick thinking
- **Willpower (WIL):** force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasiveness

Roll d8 for each **ability** to assign **ability dice** (AD) and gain **ability points** (AP) equal to each die's highest face. (Or assign d6 to each, optionally lowering one to d4 to raise one to d8.)

d8|Ability Die
:--|--:
1-4|d4
5-6|d6
7-8|d8

Roll your ability dice and keep the highest single die result. Gain that many **hit points** (HP), representing your ability to avoid critical harm. (Or start with 4 HP.)

Roll or choose a **background** and gain the associated **skill** and **equipment**.
