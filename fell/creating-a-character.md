## Hirelings

**Hirelings** are nonplayer characters (or NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings have d4 hit die (or HD) with 4 hit points (or HP), one skill, and 8 equipment slots (4+HD). When performing a relevant test, you may add your hireling's die to your roll.

Hirelings cost 5 coin per day. You may pay 5 additional coin per day to employ a hireling with a higher HD or an additional skill. If not paid upfront, you must roll a WIL contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

## Spells

Roll your WIL die to see if you know any **spells**. If you do, roll on the spell table to determine which ones.

Roll|Spells Known
:--|--:
1-4|0
5-6|1
7-8|2

If you have any **spells**, you gain a **spell die** (or SD) of any size, which you can change as often as you'd like.

You must roll a test using your spell die to cast a spell. Subtract the result of your spell die from your WIL.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce the effects.

Later, you may learn a total number of spells equal to the highest number on your WIL ability die. When you gain an undefined spell, roll on the spell table to determine which one.
