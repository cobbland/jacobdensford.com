**Example character:** *Jane is a charming young woman with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time. She plans on stealing from one of her companions.*

## Attributes

You have three attributes:

- **Body (BOD):** Constitution, grit, reflexes, strength
- **Intellect (INT):** Aim, cunning, intelligence, perception
- **Willpower (WIL):** Force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasiveness

Roll on the following table for each attribute and assign dice. Alternatively, assign a d6 to each attribute, or assign an array of d4, d6, and d8. An attribute's value ranges from d4 to d12.

d4|Attribute Die
:--|:--
1|d4
2-3|d6
4|d8

You have a point pool (or PP) for each attribute consisting of as many points as the attribute's die.

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gets a d6 in BOD, a d8 in INT, and a d4 in WIL. She has a PP of 6 in BOD, 8 in INT, and 4 in WIL.*

## Backgrounds

Roll, choose, or write your own background and gain an associated skill at d6.

10|tracker|survival

**Example character:** *Jane rolled the cutpurse background and gains the skullduggery skill at d6.*

## Skills

There are ten skills. Roll on the skill die table and then the skill table three times, assigning each skill die to the rolled skill. Alternatively, assign a d4 to three skills. Once gained, a skill's value ranges from d4 to d12.

## Feats

Roll or choose one feat.

d10|Feat
:--|---
1| **Berserk:** When you hit and deal harm, you may make additional tests to deal harm until you fail.
2| **Counterspell:** You may force a WIL contest to prevent someone from casting a spell.
3| **Expertise:** You may spend 1 INT to reroll a skill die.
4| **Jack of all Trades:** You may spend 1 INT to roll a d4 with any skill, increasing INT spent to increase the die.
5| **Powerful Strike:** When you hit and deal harm, spend 1 BOD to deal double harm.
6| **Protect:** You may take the BOD harm that someone nearby would have taken instead of them.
7| **Sneak Attack:** When you hit and deal harm to someone engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence, you may deal double harm.
8| **Spellcasting:** You may cast spells and you gain one spell--whenever taking the "gain feat" option from the XP table, you may gain another spell instead.
9| **Spellshield:** You may take harm to WIL instead of BOD or INT.
10|

**Example character:** *Jane rolled and got sneak attack as her feat.*

## Spells

Each spell costs WIL. If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce the effects. A spell's effects are multiplied by multiplying the points spent.

1|darkness|1
2|detect magic|1
3|feather fall|1

## Equipment

You have 4+BOD equipment slots. Roll or choose an equipment bundle, or spend 100 coin on the tables below.

Unless otherwise noted, items use one slot and harm is dealt to BOD.

Armor grants armor points (or AP). Instead of taking harm to your BOD, you may choose to take it to your AP. Once out of AP, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.
