10| **Spellshield:** You may take harm to WIL instead of BOD.

**Example character:** *Jane rolled and got sneak attack as her feat.*

## Spells

Spells cost WIL to cast and start at level 1, with the level and effect increasing by multiplying the cost. If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce the effects. For the purposes of these spells, an object is anything that can be held in one hand, a creature is anything about the size of a human, and a room is about thirty by thirty square feet.

When you gain a spell, roll to determine which one.
