# Creating a Character

You are a player character (or PC)--a knave, wretch, or scoundrel seeking fortune in a corrupted land filled with danger. Or perhaps you're a hero--the last light in an ever darkening world. The choice is yours.

Each has attribute points (or AP) and a corresponding attribute die (or AD).

## Spells

Spells cost WIL to cast and grant a d4 spell die or (SD). A spell's effects are multiplied and its die is increased by multiplying the cost.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce the effects.

For the purpose of spells, an object is anything that can be held in one hand, a creature is anything about the size of a human, and a room is about thirty by thirty square feet.

When you gain a spell, roll to determine which one.

## Equipment

You have 4+BOD equipment slots (or slots). Roll for an equipment bundle.

Weapons grant a steel die (or SD). Whenever you make a test with a weapon, you may add its steel die to your roll.

Armor grants protection from harm in the form of protection points (or PP). Instead of taking harm to your attribute, you may choose to take it to your protection. Once out of PP, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.

Bulky equipment uses 2 slots.

Blast harm applies to multiple targets in close proximity.

Unless otherwise noted, items use one slot, harm is dealt to one target's BOD, and protection only applies to BOD.

## Character Advancement

You gain experience points (or XP) whenever you allow your styles, drives, flaws, or bonds to put you in a tight spot.

When your XP reaches the highest number on a die, you gain that die as an experience die (or XD).

You may spend your experience points by rolling a test against one of your attributes with your experience die. If you succeed, increase that attribute by one point. Regardless, reduce your XP by the number rolled.

**Example Character:** *Jane gains an experience point, bringing her XP up to 4, which means she gains a d4 experience die. She rolls that die against her WIL and gets a 4, increasing her WIL from 4 to 5 and reducing her XP to zero.*

## Example Character

*Jane is a charming cutpurse with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time. She plans on stealing from one of her companions.*

**BOD:** 7/7 (d6) -- *Protection:* 2/2 | **INT:** 8/8 (d8) | **WIL:** 5/5 (d4)

**Skills (d8):** Discernment, Lore, Skullduggery, Speechcraft

**Equipment (5/10 slots):** light armor (2 protection, bulky), dagger (d4, 1 harm), shortbow (d4, 1 harm), arrows, lockpicks, 10 coin
