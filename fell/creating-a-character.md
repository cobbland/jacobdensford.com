**Example character:** *Jane is a charming young woman with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time. She plans on stealing from one of her companions.*

## Abilities

You have three abilities:

- **Body (BOD):** Constitution, grit, reflexes, strength
- **Intellect (INT):** Aim, cunning, intelligence, perception
- **Willpower (WIL):** Force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasiveness

Each has ability points (or AP) and a corresponding ability die (or AD).

Roll 4d4 for each ability to determine your ability points and ability die.

AP|AD
:--|:--
0-3|d0
4-5|d4
6-7|d6
8-9|d8
10-11|d10
12-19|d12
20|d20

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gains 7 ability points in BOD, 8 in INT, and 4 in WIL; granting her a d6 ability die in BOD, d8 in INT, and d4 in WIL.*

## Backgrounds

Roll for your background and gain the associated skill.

2|priest|discernment

4|bard|performance
5|blacksmith|repair
6|politician|speechcraft
7|cutpurse|skullduggery
8|hunter|survival

**Example character:** *Jane rolls the cutpurse background and gains skullduggery.*

## Skills

There are eight skills.

You have a skill die (or SD) equal to your INT ability die.

Roll on the skill table to gain a skill.

3|lore
4|performance
5|repair
6|skullduggery
7|speechcraft
8|survival

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gains speechcraft. Her skill die is d8*

## Spells

Spells cost WIL to cast and grant a spell die (or SD)--d4 for 4 WIL, d6 for 6, etc.

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may force a contest to reduce the effects.

For the purpose of spells, an object is anything that can be held in one hand, a creature is anything about the size of a human, and a room is about thirty by thirty square feet.

When you gain a spell, roll on the spell list in *[Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn)*, *[Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave)*, or similar to determine which one.

## Equipment

You have 4+BOD equipment slots (or slots). Roll for an equipment bundle.

Weapons grant a steel die (or SD). Whenever you make a test with a weapon, you may add its steel die to your roll.

Armor grants protection from harm in the form of protection points (or PP). Instead of taking harm to your ability, you may choose to take it to your protection. Once out of PP, the armor is broken and must be repaired before granting this benefit again.

Bulky equipment uses 2 slots and generally requires two hands to carry or wield.

Blast harm applies to multiple targets in close proximity. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll the weapon's steel die.

Unless otherwise noted, items use one slot, harm is dealt to one target's BOD, and protection only applies to BOD.

## Character Advancement

You gain experience points (or XP) whenever you allow your styles, drives, flaws, or bonds to put you in a tight spot.

When your XP reaches the highest number on a die, you gain that die as an experience die (or XD).

You may spend your experience points by rolling a test against one of your abilities with your experience die. If you succeed, increase that ability by one point. Regardless, reduce your XP by the die rolled.

**Example Character:** *Jane gains an experience point, bringing her XP up to 4, which means she gains a d4 experience die. She rolls that die against her WIL and gets a 4, increasing her WIL from 4 to 5 and reducing her XP to zero.*

## Example Character

*Jane is a charming cutpurse with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time. She plans on stealing from one of her companions.*

**BOD:** 7/7 (d6) -- *Protection:* 2/2 | **INT:** 8/8 (d8) | **WIL:** 5/5 (d4)

**Skills (d8):** Skullduggery, Speechcraft

**Equipment (5/10 slots):** light armor (2 protection, bulky), dagger (d4, 1 harm), shortbow (d4, 1 harm), arrows, lockpicks, 10 coin
