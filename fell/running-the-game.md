# Running the Game

## Time Die

One way to track time while traveling, exploring, or during an encounter is to use a d6. Start the d6 with the "one" side facing up. After each round, flip the die to the next highest side and check for encounters. After you've cycled through the whole die, check for rest, food, light sources, etc. Then begin again.

- During an encounter, one full die represents a minute.
- While exploring, one full die represents an hour.
- When traveling, one full die represents six hours.

## The Basic Procedure

> You have probably been using a set of rules (more accurately a procedure) that you never read in any rulebook. And not just a little. It is probably the bread-and-butter procedure for your gaming group, even if you haven’t understood it as such. At first blush, the procedure hides itself as “conversation.” But I suspect that is just evidence for how powerful, how transformative and how natural this procedure is. I will quit stalling for now, but expect me to bloviate at length on what this procedure means; here is what I call the “Basic Procedure”:

> - Step 1. The referee describes the situation, what the player-characters see, hear, smell, taste or feel.
> - Step 2. The players ask clarifying questions about the situation, if they so desire.
> - Step 3. The referee answers any such questions that are immediately observable by the player-characters. If ascertaining the answer would require player-character action, the referee informs the players what they must do to obtain the answer, and resolves such actions if the players wish to do so. Upon the resolution of such actions, the referee answers the question and gives any other pertinent information.
> - Step 4. Based on the information at hand, the players state what actions their player-characters take.
> - Step 5. The referee and players resolve all such actions. If the situation changes (which it almost certainly will), repeat these steps.

## Post-Session

> The reactive potential of tools is also why my most important prep occurs immediately after running a session. While I’m writing out my recap of events (something I’m indulgently excessive about), I have a set of questions to ask myself:

> - Did the players encounter any interesting NPCs that it would be fun to add to my Recurring Characters table?
> - Did the party wrong anyone who might hold a grudge against them? What form might revenge take? (Put this on the consequences table).
> - Does anyone feel that they owe the party a favor? What might they do to settle the debt? (Put this on the consequences table).
> - Review all the table entries used, and restock anything that needs it.
> - What parts of the session were rough, and what tools or techniques would help them work better in future?

## Converting OSR Material

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to two OSR abilities.

Fell|OSR
:--|--:
Weight|Strength, Constitution
Wit|Intelligence, Dexterity
Will|Wisdom, Charisma

### Hit Dice

Use the table below for guidance.

OSR HD|Fell Abilities, HP, and Armor
:--|--:
1-2|d4, 1-8HP, 0-1
3-4|d6, 3-12HP, 0-1
5-6|d8, 5-16HP, 0-2
7-8|d10, 7-20HP, 0-2
9-10|d12, 9-24HP, 0-3

### Damage

Typically, use the damage dice as the steel dice. If there are multiple dice, raise the die by one or more steps. If the damage would be significantly more than d12, add bonus dice and keep the highest result when rolling harm.

### Saving Throws

Saving throws convert to tests with the relevant ability. If the effect being saved against comes from an NPC, it's a contest.

If you save...

- by powering through, use Weight
- by quick reflexes or clever thinking, use Wit
- by force of will, use Will

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists should work with *Fell* with minimal conversion, such as the [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

If a spell causes harm or healing, follow the damage guidelines above.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

If a spell uses levels, half the spell's level is added to the DN to cast the spell. This rule only applies when the spell's level is greater than half the caster's Will.
