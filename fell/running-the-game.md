# Running the Game

The facilitator plays the corrupted land and its inhabitants.

## Nonplayer Characters

Instead of attributes and point pools, most nonplayer characters (or NPCs) have a hit die (or HD) and hit points (or HP) equal to their hit die number. Roll their HD for every test and reduce their HP for any harm.
