# Running the Game

The facilitator plays the corrupted land and its inhabitants, bringing life to the dangers that harry the player characters.

## Nonplayer Characters

Instead of AD and AP, most nonplayer characters (or NPCs) have a hit die (or HD) and hit points (or HP). Use their HD and HP for everything that would normally use ADs and APs.

## Trouble

## Luck

## Random Encounters
