# Running the Game

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the PCs is uncertain, roll a **luck die**—usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Roll a luck die:

- When the PCs stop to rest in a dangerous location
- If a PC makes a loud noise in a dungeon
- After each round of exploration or travel
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Time

One way to track time while traveling, exploring, or during an encounter is to use a d6. Start the d6 with the "one" side facing up. After each round, flip the die to the next highest side and check for encounters. After you've cycled through the whole die, check for rest, food, light sources, etc. Then begin again.

During an encounter, one full die represents a minute.

While exploring, one full die represents an hour.

When traveling, one full die represents six hours.

## Difficulty

When the standard difficulty number of 4 doesn't suffice, which it usually should, consult the difficulty table below for guidance.

DN|Difficulty
:--|--:
0|Very easy
2|Easy
**4** | **Normal**
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible


## Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one passed test to accomplish. Tell how many the **extended test** will require, then PCs roll as normal. They may repeat the roll to add additional passes once they've dealt with any trouble.

## Granular Results

Optionally, instead of tests resulting in a binary pass/fail, the lower the number on a failure, the worse the outcome. The higher the number on a success, the better the outcome. You may even make 4-5 only partial success.

## Rounding Down

Unless otherwise specified or it would drop a number below one, always round down.

## Armor

Armor should never be increased beyond 3.

## Non-Protagonist Characters

**Non-protagonist characters** (NPCs) should have a name, a flavorful description, and a drive. They default to having d6 in each ability and 5 HP. If an NPC is meant to be exceptionally easy to overcome, lower their HP and reduce their abilities. If they're competent, give them more HP and increase their abilities. If they're good at something specific, give them a skill. If they're tough, give them armor. If they're quick, give them more HP. If they're magical, give them a spell.

## Longer Dice Ladder

If you have access to wacky dice or a digital dice roller, you may want to add some extra rungs to the dice ladder. For example, you could use the extra dice from [DCC](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/). Adding more dice makes PC progression slower but allows for more granularity and customization. But the lowest die should never go below d4 since the default DN is 4.

## Custom PCs

PCs may start with any name, any age, d6 in each ability (optionally, lowering one to d4 and raising one to d8), a spell of their choice if their Will is d8, 5 HP, a drive and traits of their choice or making, and either a background of their choice or one of their making—including a name for the background, a skill of their choice, and equipment worth 40 C. When advancing, gain 5 HP instead of rolling.

## Converting OSR Material

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to two OSR abilities.

Fell|OSR
:--|--:
Weight|Strength, Constitution
Wit|Intelligence, Dexterity
Will|Wisdom, Charisma

### Hit Dice

Use the table below for guidance.

OSR HD|Fell Abilities, HP, and Armor
:--|--:
1-2|d4, 1-8HP, 0-1
3-4|d6, 3-12HP, 0-1
5-6|d8, 5-16HP, 0-2
7-8|d10, 7-20HP, 0-2
9-10|d12, 9-24HP, 0-3

### Damage

Typically, use the damage dice as the steel dice. If there are multiple dice, raise the die by one or more steps. If the damage would be significantly more than d12, add bonus dice and keep the highest result when rolling harm.

### Saving Throws

Saving throws convert to tests with the relevant ability. If the effect being saved against comes from an NPC, it's a contest.

If you save...

- by powering through, use Weight
- by quick reflexes or clever thinking, use Wit
- by force of will, use Will

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists should work with *Fell* with minimal conversion, such as the [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

If a spell causes harm or healing, follow the damage guidelines above.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

If a spell uses levels, half the spell's level is added to the DN to cast the spell. This rule only applies when the spell's level is greater than one fourth the caster's Will.
