# Running the Game

The **facilitator** plays the corrupted land and its inhabitants, bringing life to the dangers that harry the player characters.

## Nonplayer Characters

Instead of ability dice and ability points, most **nonplayer characters** (or NPCs) have a **hit die** (or HD) and **hit points** (or HP). Use their HD and HP for everything that would normally use ability equivalence.

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the player characters is uncertain, roll a d6 **luck die**. Higher is better. Lower is worse.
