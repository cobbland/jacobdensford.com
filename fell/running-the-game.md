# Running the Game

The **facilitator** plays the corrupted land and its inhabitants, bringing life to the dangers that harry the player characters.

## Nonplayer Characters

**Nonplayer Characters** (or NPCs) can be townsfolk, hirelings, monsters, or anything in between.

All NPCs should have a **name**, a flavorful **description**, and a **drive**.

Instead of ability dice and ability points, most NPCs have a **hit die** (or HD) and **hit points** (or HP). Use their HD and HP for everything that would normally use an ability equivalent.

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the player characters is uncertain, roll a **luck die**--usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Roll a luck die:

- When the player characters stop to rest while in a dangerous location
- When a player character fails a test
- After each round of dungeon exploration and wilderness navigation

## Optional Rules

All rules are optional. These, especially so.

### Customizing Player Characters

Instead of rolling on tables, player characters can be created using choice.

For names and traits, player characters may choose or write their own for each.

For ability dice, they may assign a d6 to each or assign a d4 to one, a d6 to one, and a d8 to one.

For backgrounds, they may choose or create their own, gaining one skill of their choice and purchasing equipment worth 60 coin.

If their WIL is d8, they may gain one spell of their choice.

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists work with *Fell*.

Some examples include:

- [More Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/) from [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/)
- A list of 100 level-less spells from [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave)
- The [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page)

If a spell causes harm, follow the guidelines in the section on converting OSR material to determine how much.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

### Spell Levels

If playing with spells that have levels, or spells that are modified by the level at which they are cast, the spell die used for the test must have at least as many faces as the spell's level or the level used.

### Converting OSR Material

#### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to three OSR abilities, but it's not an exact conversion.

Fell|OSR
:--|---
Body|Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Intellect|Intelligence, Dexterity, Wisdom
Willpower|Wisdom, Charisma, Intelligence

#### Hit Dice and Hit Points

In *Fell*, an NPC has one hit die and a number of hit points equal to the die's highest number. If an NPC is meant to be easy to overcome, use a d4 for their HD. If they're meant to be an extreme challenge, use a d12. In rare cases, a d20 might even be appropriate.

#### Damage

Typically, use the damage die as the steel die. On a hit, apply harm according to the following table.

Die|Harm
:--|:--
1d4|1
1d6|2
1d8|3
1d10|4
1d12|5

#### Difficulty Class

Convert a tasks difficulty class (or DC) to a difficulty number (or DN) using the table below.

DC|DN
:--|:--
0-4|0
5-9|2
10-14|4
15-19|6
20-24|8
25-29|10
30+|12
