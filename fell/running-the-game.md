# Running the Game

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the PCs is uncertain, roll a **luck die**—usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Roll a luck die:

- When the PCs stop to rest in a dangerous location
- When a PC fails a test
- If a PC makes a loud noise in a dungeon
- After each round of dungeon exploration and wilderness navigation
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Time

One way to track time while traveling, exploring, or during an encounter is to use a d6. Start the d6 with the "one" side facing up. After each round, flip the die to the next highest side. After you've cycled through the whole die, check for rest, food, light sources, etc. Then begin again.

During an encounter, one full die represents a minute.

While exploring, one full die represents an hour.

When traveling, one full die represents six hours.

## Difficulty

When the standard difficulty number of 4 doesn't suffice, which it usually should, consult the difficulty table below for guidance.

DN|Difficulty
:--|--:
0|Very easy
2|Easy
**4** | **Normal**
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

## Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one passed test to accomplish. Tell how many the **extended test** will require, then PCs roll as normal. They may repeat the roll to add additional passes once they've dealt with any trouble.

## Protection

Protection should never, or very rarely, be increased beyond 3.

## Non-Protagonist Characters

**Non-protagonist characters** (NPCs) can be townsfolk, hirelings, monsters, or anything in between.

All NPCs should have a **name**, a flavorful **description**, and a **drive**.

NPCs default to having d4 in each ability and 3 HP. If an NPC is meant to be exceptionally easy to overcome, lower their HP. If they're competent, give them d6s and 5 HP. If they're particularly strong, smart, or magical; raise that ability's die to d8, or even higher, and bump their HP up by 1 or 2. If what they're good at is more specific, give them a skill. If they're tough, give them armor. If they're quick, give them more HP.

## Optional Rules

All rules are optional. These, especially so.

### Customizing Backgrounds

PCs may create their own backgrounds, gaining one skill of their choice and purchasing equipment worth 60 coin.

### Longer Dice Ladder

If you have access to wacky dice or a digital dice roller, you may want to add some extra rungs to the dice ladder. For example, if using dice from [DCC](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/), the ladder would look like this:

**d3 → d4 → d5 → d6 → d7 → d8 → d10 → d12 → etc**

## Converting OSR Material

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to three OSR abilities, but it's not an exact conversion.

Fell|OSR
:--|--:
Body|Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Intellect|Intelligence, Dexterity, Wisdom
Willpower|Wisdom, Charisma, Intelligence

### Ability Dice and Hit Points

Use the table below for guidance.

OSR HD|Fell AD and HP
:--|--:
1|d4 2HP
2|d4 3HP
3|d6 4HP
4|d6 5HP
5|d8 6HP
6|d8 7HP
7|d10 8HP
8|d10 9HP
9|d12 10HP
10|d12 11HP
11+|d12+ 12HP+

### Damage

Typically, use the damage die as the steel die. Sometimes, step the die down one if it feels like too much. If the damage would be significantly more than a d12, roll twice and take the higher result.

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists should work with *Fell*, such as the [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

If a spell causes harm, follow the damage guidelines above.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

If the spell uses levels, the spell's level is the difficulty number for the test that must be rolled to cast the spell.
