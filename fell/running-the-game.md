# Running the Game

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the PCs is uncertain, roll a **luck die**â€”usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Roll a luck die:

- When the PCs stop to rest in a dangerous location
- When a PC fails a test
- If a PC makes a loud noise in a dungeon
- After each round of dungeon exploration and wilderness navigation
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Time

One way to track time while traveling, exploring, or during an encounter is to use a d6. Start the d6 with the "one" side facing up. After each round, flip the die to the next highest side. After you've cycled through the whole die, check for rest, food, light sources, etc. Then begin again.

During an encounter, one full die represents a minute.

While exploring, one full die represents an hour.

When traveling, one full die represents six hours.

## Difficulty

When the standard difficulty number of 4 doesn't suffice, which it usually should, consult the difficulty table below for guidance.

DN|Difficulty
:--|--:
0|Very easy
2|Easy
**4** | **Normal**
6|Hard
8|Very hard
10|Extremely hard
12|Nearly impossible

## Rounding Down

Unless otherwise specified, always round down.

## Extended Tests

Some tests require more time and effort, and thus require more than one passed test to accomplish. Tell how many the **extended test** will require, then PCs roll as normal. They may repeat the roll to add additional passes once they've dealt with any trouble.

## Protection

Protection should never, or extremely rarely, be increased beyond 3.

## Non-Protagonist Characters

**Non-protagonist characters** (NPCs) can be townsfolk, hirelings, monsters, or anything in between.

All NPCs should have a **name**, a flavorful **description**, and a **drive**.

NPCs default to having d4 in each ability and 3 HP. If an NPC is meant to be exceptionally easy to overcome, lower their HP. If they're competent, give them d6s and 5 HP. If they're particularly strong, smart, or magical; raise that ability's die to d8, or even higher, and bump their HP up by 1 or 2. If what they're good at is more specific, give them a skill. If they're tough, give them armor. If they're quick, give them more HP.

## Longer Dice Ladder

If you have access to wacky dice or a digital dice roller, you may want to add some extra rungs to the dice ladder. For example, you could use the extra dice from [DCC](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/). Adding more dice makes PC progression slower but allows for more granularity and customization. But the lowest die should never go below d4 since the default DN is 4.

## Converting OSR Material

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to three OSR abilities, but it's not an exact conversion.

Fell|OSR
:--|--:
Body|Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Intellect|Intelligence, Dexterity, Wisdom
Willpower|Wisdom, Charisma, Intelligence

### Ability Dice and Hit Points

Use the table below for guidance.

OSR HD|Fell AD, HP, and P
:--|--:
1-2|d4, 2-8HP, 0-1
3-4|d6, 3-12HP, 0-1
5-6|d8, 4-16HP, 0-2
7-8|d10, 5-20HP, 0-2
9-10|d12, 6-24HP, 0-3

### Damage

Typically, use the damage die as the steel die. If there are multiple dice, only use the highest result. If the damage would be significantly more than a d12, roll multiple dice and take the highest result.

### Saving Throws

Saving throws convert to tests with the relevent ability. If the effect being saved against comes from an NPC, it's a contest. What follows is a table giving guidelines for which ability to test with, but use whatever makes the most sense given the circumstance.

OSR Saving Throw|Fell Ability
:--|--:
Death or Poison (D)|Body
Wands (W)|Willpower
Paralysis or Petrification (P)|Body
Breath Attacks (B)|Intellect
Spells, Rods, or Staves (S)|Willpower

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists should work with *Fell*, such as the [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

If a spell causes harm, follow the damage guidelines above.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

If the spell uses levels, half the spell's level is added to the DN to cast the spell. Optionally, this rule only applies when the spell's level is greater than one fourth the highest face of the caster's WIL.
