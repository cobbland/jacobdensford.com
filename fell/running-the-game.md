# Running the Game

The **facilitator** plays the corrupted land and its inhabitants, bringing life to the dangers that harry the player characters.

## Nonplayer Characters

**Nonplayer Characters** (or NPCs) can be townsfolk, hirelings, monsters, or anything in between.

All NPCs should have a **name**, a flavorful **description**, and a **drive**.

Instead of ability dice and ability points, most NPCs have a **hit die** (or HD) and **hit points** (or HP). Use their HD and HP for everything that would normally use an ability equivalent.

## Luck

When the way in which the world reacts to the player characters is uncertain, roll a **luck die**--usually a d6. Higher is better for the PCs. Lower is worse.

Roll a luck die:

- When the player characters stop to rest in a dangerous location
- When a player character fails a test
- After each round of dungeon exploration and wilderness navigation
- To see if a trap is triggered

## Time

One way to track time while navigating the wilderness, exploring a dungeon or during an encounter is to use a d6. Start the d6 with the "one" side facing up. After each round, flip the die to the next highest side. After you've cycled through the whole die, check for rest, food, light sources, etc. Then begin again.

During an encounter, one full die represents a minute.

While exploring a dungeon, one full die represents an hour.

When navigating the wilderness, one full die represents six hours.

## Optional Rules

All rules are optional. These, especially so.

### Customizing Player Characters

Instead of rolling on tables, player characters can be created using choice.

For names and traits, player characters may choose or write their own for each.

For ability dice, they may assign a d4 to one and a d6 to two, or a d4 to two and a d8 to one.

For backgrounds, they may choose or create their own, gaining one skill of their choice and purchasing equipment worth 60 coin.

If their WIL is d8, they may gain one spell of their choice.

### Alternative Spell Lists

Most OSR-compatible spell lists work with *Fell*.

Some examples include:

- [More Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/) from [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/)
- A list of 100 level-less spells from [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave)
- The [Magic-User Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells) and [Cleric Spells](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Cleric_Spells) from [Old-School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page)

If a spell causes harm, follow the guidelines in the section on converting OSR material to determine how much.

If a spell requires a save, it's a contest.

If the spell uses levels, consult the table below to see which spell die must be rolled.

Level|Die
:--|--:
1|d2
2|d4
3|d6
4|d8
5|d10
6|d12

### Converting OSR Material

#### Abilities

Each of the three abilities in *Fell* roughly corresponds to three OSR abilities, but it's not an exact conversion.

Fell|OSR
:--|--:
Body|Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Intellect|Intelligence, Dexterity, Wisdom
Willpower|Wisdom, Charisma, Intelligence

#### Hit Dice and Hit Points

In *Fell*, an NPC has one hit die and a number of hit points equal to the die's highest number. If an NPC is meant to be easy to overcome, use a d4 for their HD (or even a d2). If they're meant to be an extreme challenge, use a d12 (or even a d20). Use the table below as a guideline.

OSR HD|Fell HD
:--|--:
1|d4
2|d4
3|d6
4|d6
5|d8
6|d8
7|d10
8|d10
9|d12
10|d12
11+|d20

#### Damage

Typically, use the damage die as the steel die.
