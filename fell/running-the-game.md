# Running the Game

The facilitator plays the corrupted land and its inhabitants, bringing life to the dangers that harry the player characters.

## Nonplayer Characters

Instead of AD and AP, most nonplayer characters (or NPCs) have a hit die (or HD) and hit points (or HP). Use their HD and HP for everything that would normally use ADs and APs.

## Consequences

When a PC makes a test and their highest die is a weak hit, or when they fail a test but choose to push, there should always be consequences. Consequences of a weak hit might be taking extra time or expending extra resources. Consequences of pushing a failed test to pass should be at least twice as bad.

## Luck
