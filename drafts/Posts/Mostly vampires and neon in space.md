# Mostly vampires and neon in space

It's mid-June, which means [Summer Game Fest](https://www.summergamefest.com/) and [E3](https://e3expo.com/) are both heating up. Since I only have four thousand games in my to-be-played pile, I might as well add some more. And there are so many good options in my favorite genre: retro-future neon space vampire pixel art. Here I've collected all the new games I'm most looking forward to. (This list will be updated over the coming days as more announcements are made.)

I've never actually finished a Bethesda game. But I've played the first few hours of a few of them. And I've liked what I've played. So I'm definitely looking forward to playing the first few hours of *Skyrim* in space.

## [The Outer Worlds 2](https://outerworlds.obsidian.net/en)

https://youtu.be/ClhDyC0ZECs

I haven't played the first one yet. But I really want to! Maybe now that a sequel is in the works, I'll finally get around to it.

## [A Plague Tale: Requiem](https://www.focus-home.com/en-us/games/a-plague-tale-requiem)

https://youtu.be/Y-Q5wHtguZI

A game I actually did finish was *A Plague Tale: Innocence*. It was one of my favorites of the past few years. Looking forward to the sequel.

## [Twelve Minutes](https://twelveminutesgame.com/)

https://youtu.be/izoUXOMyVyk

A small time travel murder mystery game featuring Professor Charles Xavier, Jedi Master Rey Skywalker, and the Green Goblin.

## [Bloodhunt](https://bloodhunt.com/en-us)

https://youtu.be/c9TE9vQuVHQ

My favorite part of battle royal games is that quiet ten or fifteen minutes where you're sneaking through abandoned buildings collecting guns and ammo. But I don't like using said guns and ammo. I once got second place in *PUBG* without firing a single shot. Hoping to do that but as a vampire.

## [Redfall](https://bethesda.net/en/game/redfall)

https://youtu.be/3pWjcqXnP2g

Speaking of vampires... *Left 4 Dead* but make in vampires? Count me in.

## [The Anacrusis](https://www.theanacrusis.com/)

https://youtu.be/j1b78SCATeY

Speaking of *Left 4 Dead*... *Left 4 Dead* but make it aliens? Count me in.

## [Back 4 Blood](https://back4blood.com/en-us)

https://youtu.be/3DyHQHgOkjw

Speaking of *Left 4 Dead* again... *Left 4 Dead* but make it *Left 4 Dead*. Again. Count me in.

## [Replaced](https://playreplaced.com/)

https://youtu.be/_P5OlfGbk5g

A cyberpunk-looking game that looks like it might actually understand the genre.

## [The Ascent](https://www.curve-digital.com/en-us/games/featured/156/the-ascent/)

https://youtu.be/LKicBN0ZY20

A cyberpunk-looking game that looks like it might not understand the genre.

## [Atomic Heart](https://mundfish.com/)

https://youtu.be/lG4kPj05OlM

Retro-future Soviet Union first-person shooter. Now with soup.

## [IXION](https://dolos.org/)

https://youtu.be/iPzEZbY-HhE

Space station management sim.

## [Starmancer](https://www.playstarmancer.com/)

https://youtu.be/mRcb_ypY1Uw

Space station management sim but make it pixel art.

## [Death Trash](http://deathtrash.com/index.html)

https://youtu.be/D1oA9yUrnlY

Pixel art but make it a cosmic horror RPG.

## [Somerville](https://jumpship.co.uk/)

https://youtu.be/sr_JKrT5eEQ

Alien apocalypse family road trip? I hope so.

## [Hellblade 2: Senua's Saga](https://senuassaga.com/)

https://youtu.be/rWoySrKxPlI

The upcoming sequel to another game I actually finished and another favorite. This is one of the games I'm looking forward to most.

## [Sable](https://www.shed-works.co.uk/sable)

https://youtu.be/Fojy_YRseGk

Looks like *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, but if Moebius drew it and Japanese Breakfast did the soundtrack. (Japanese Breakfast actually did do the soundtrack.)
