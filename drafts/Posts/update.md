A lot has changed recently. The Big Trip ended, I spent some time at my parents' house in West Virginia, then I stayed with my cousin and his family in Virginia while I searched for an apartment. Eventually, I found one. But it took a long time. Longer than I thought it would, anyway. Real estate, am I right?

## COVID-19

Woke up early on a Sunday ready to drag my cousin, who I was staying with while looking for a more permanent housing situation, to the gym. His son had developed a cough in the night. Even though by morning he was feeling much better, we decided to put one of our four government issued COVID tests to work.

I was cooking breakfast. Half a dozen eggs were ready to go into a hot pan when the prescribed fifteen minutes had past and the results came in.

Positive.

Second test, just to be sure.

Positive.

We decided not to cook the eggs. Obviously we were no longer going to the gym. Or to my Aunt's house to celebrate Mother's Day. Or anywhere for the next couple weeks.

By the end of the day, everyone but me had developed symptoms. And it was too late for me to leave. Short of returning to living in my car, I had no where else to go where I wouldn't put others at risk.

For the first few days, as my cousin and his wife's health deteriorated, I remained symptom free. I helped out around the house as much as I could--making food, doing dishes, trying to wrangle the now healthy and energetic children. I was happy to help. I was just grateful not to be sick.

Then I got sick.

The next two days are a feverish blur. I have no idea what we ate, but I assume someone fed the kids. I didn't leave the couch.

Day three of being symptomatic with COVID-19. Starting to feel better already.
