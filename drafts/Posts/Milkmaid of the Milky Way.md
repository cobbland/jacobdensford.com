# Milkmaid of the Milky Way

![](/Images/_milkmaid.jpg)

I thought I'd try adventure games again,

So I purchased this one up from a sale.

At two hours long, should not cause me much pain.

I can finish before the moonrise, pale.

You play a girl atop a fjord so green,

With cattle she milks to make butter and cheese.

'Til a flying ship takes them in the sheen

Of its magic beam, locked up without keys.

The story, music, and art are all quite nice.

You are a hero in this tragic tale.

I was even moved to tears once or twice.

And challenging puzzlesâ€”I did not fail.

The dialogue is told in rhyme resplendent. 

Hence this review sonnet. **I recommend it.**
