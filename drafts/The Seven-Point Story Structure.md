The Seven-Point Story Structure
=========================

***A System for planning and outlining a story of any size, based on a presentation by Dan Wells, author of*** **I Am Not a Serial Killer,** ***which he based on instructions for planning a game from the*** **Star Trek Roleplaying Game Narrator's Guide.**

# The Seven Points

- Hook
- Plot Turn 1
- Pinch 1
- Midpoint
- Pinch 2
- Plot Turn 2
- Resolution

# Building a Story

- Have a story in mind.
  - Who are the characters?
  - What is the setting?
  - What is the major conflict?
- Start at the end: **Resolution**.
- Then the opposite character state: **Hook**.
- Then the "let's do something" moment:  **Midpoint**.
- Next introduce conflict: **Plot Turn 1**.
- And then get the last piece of the puzzle: **Plot Turn 2**.
- Apply pressure and force characters to action: **Pinch 1**.
- Make things even worse: **Pinch 2**.

## Resolution

- Everything in your story leads to this moment.
- What is your story about? Where is your story going?
- Make sure you know what kind of resolution you want.

## Hook

- Now that you know where you're going, figure out where you start.
- One simple trick is to start with the opposite state--if a character is going to end strong, he should start weak. This creates an arc of progress.
- This is another reason why it's so vital to *know your ending*.

## Midpoint

- The midpoint is the exact center between the two states. It is the point at which the characters begin moving from one state to the other.
- The characters move from reaction to action.

## Plot Turn 1

- Just as the midpoint moves you from beginning to end, Plot Turn 1 moves you from beginning to midpoint.
- Introduce the conflict.
- The character's world changes:
  - Meet new people.
  - Discover new secrets.
  - Follow the White Rabbit.

## Plot Turn 2

- Move the story from midpoint to end.
- At the midpoint you determine to do something, and in the resolution you do it, so Plot Turn 2 is where you obtain the final thing you need to make it happen.
- "The power is in you!"

## Pinch 1

- Apply pressure:
  - Something goes wrong.
  - Bad guys attack.
  - Peace is destroyed.
- Force characters to action.
- Often used to introduce the villain.

## Pinch 2

- Apply more pressure until the situation seems hopeless:
  - A plan fails.
  - A mentor dies, leaving the heroes alone.
  - The bad guys seem to win.
- These are the jaws of defeat from which your hero will be snatching victory--make sure the teeth are sharp!

# Extras

- Round characters
- Rich evironments
- The "Ice Monster" prologue
- Try/fail cycles
- Subplots (depending on story size)

## The "Ice Monster" Prologue

- The hook scene in most story arcs, especially adventure stories, is not very interesting:
  - Most arcs start in a position of weakness.
  - Most plots start before the conflict is introduced.
  - You need to grab your readers' attention now, but you also need to lay the foundation for a strong story twenty chapters from now.
- The ice monster prologue lets you start with something exciting and hint at all the cool stuff to come before you launch into your real plot.

## Try/Fail Cycles

- Before the heroes succeed at anything important, they should try and fail at least twice.
- Victory should be earned.
- A problem that can be solved on the first try is not a big enough problem for your readers to care about.

## Plots and Subplots

- Most stories have more than one plot.
- Each thread of plot, action, and growth can be mapped out with the seven-point system.
- Spread out the events to create good pacing.
- Line up the events to create powerful moments and scenes.
