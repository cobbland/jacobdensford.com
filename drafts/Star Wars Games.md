# Star Wars Games

Skipping the eighties arcade and Atari games, but talk about that one arcade game that you grew up playing in manitu springs, co. Talk about the scope of the project: Star Wars games released in the '90s--then the '00s, followed by the '10s--that are currently available for legal purchase on PC (Steam or GOG), PS4, or Switch (and some mobile games that are currently available in the Play Store and not super micro transaction heavy) and that aren't weird little kid games or educational games. Also might have a provision for if I'm stuck on one part for an hour and not having fun anymore, pass on the game. I should also talk about the incredible number of weird game boy, web, and mobile games that were mostly developed in the '00s.

Start with 1992's Super Star Wars for the Super Nintendo, played on PS4. Talk about playing it as a child without being able to save, but that now you can save and reload from anywhere, which is almost the only thing that makes in playable. Talk about the next two games in the series being better with the level codes, but also how they're not currently available legally, unless you own the original cartridges and a super Nintendo console.

With X-Wing, talk about the different versions and whats good and bad about each. (Still have to decide which version to play.) Also maybe talk about joysticks. Could mention playing this game at those people's house in New York--the dad who loved star wars but wouldn't let you touch any of his collectibles and who got really mad when you beat him at Star Wars Trivial Pursuit in a single turn. (Maybe mention the dreaded probe droid leg number question.) Talk about the extra steps I had to take to get the game to run right with music and everything. How hard it is.
