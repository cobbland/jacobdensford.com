Kids aren't allowed to play Shanghai with the grown ups. Those were the rules. Mom and Dad, Grandma and Grandpa, aunts and uncles would gather around the grown up table, cards in hand, accompanied by glasses of ice cold Coca-Cola and chips and dip on Henn Pottery plates.

Me, my siblings, and my cousins were relegated to the kids table, but no one was keeping us from having our own game. We would drink our plastic cups of Sprite and Mug, eat our chips and dip from paper plates, and try and fail to finish a game of Shanghai without parental guidance. Our failure was more from lack of attention span than anything else.

It didn't really matter that we couldn't get through a game of Shanghai or join the adults at their sacred table. The important part was the dip, and we had plenty of it.

Before long, more siblings and cousins were born, and we got old enough to join the grown up table. A blessing. And a curse.

"Does anyone even like this game?"

"Why are we playing this again?"

"Who started this tradition anyway?"

Those are just a few of the questions one might hear around the table when we sit down for another game of Shanghai. The answer to all of them—at least the most important ones—is one word: dip.

Once the game got going and everyone had their plate of snacks, someone would inevitably say, "The dip tastes especially creamy this time," which always reignited the age old debate of whether or not creamy is a taste or just a texture. (I say it's both.)

Grandpa had a handful of phrases he'd repeat over and over during a game of Shanghai. Most of them included an announcement of which hand we were on.

"One set and one run. Aren't we having lots of fun?"

"Two sets and one run. Aren't we having lots of fun?"

"One set and two runs. Aren't we having lots of fun?"

And then, after an elbow from Grandma, "Alright. I'll hush. Alright. I'll hush. I'll hush. I'll hush." He was singing it by the end. "I'll hush, I'll hush, I'll hush."

Dad's go-to, which the rest of us have wholeheartedly adopted, is "Let's keep this breezing right along."

Dad has made the World Famous Densford Secret Family Recipe Chip Dip for as long as I can remember. It isn't a family gathering, especially a card based family gathering, without THE dip. It is an integral part of our get-togethers. (Last year's cream cheese shortage was hard on us.)

This past summer, Dad finally handed over the keys to the kingdom: the recipe and responsibility for THE dip.

- 2 packets ranch dip mix  
- 1 lb sour cream  
- 1 lb cream cheese  

The ingredients might seem simple, it's just a slight variation on the recipe from the back of the dip mix package, after all. But there are subtle nuances in technique and specificity of ingredients that one must consider.

First, everything must be "name brand". Listen, I know, I know. But I've tried it with store brands and it just doesn't come out the same. You need Philadelphia cream cheese, Daisy sour cream, and—most importantly—Hidden Valley ranch dip mix.

Second, you need to let that cream cheese warm up a little. It should be almost room temperature. It should still have a little stiffness to it but not too much. The best way is to let it sit on the counter for half an hour. But, if you're in a pinch, you can message it in your hands or stick it in your armpits for a few minutes. Whatever you do, DO NOT MICROWAVE IT. That's a recipe for a dip of poor consistency.

Lastly, you need an electric mixer. A spoon or hand mixer just won't do; not with the cream cheese still being a little stiff and all. But you don't need a fancy stand mixer. Just a little handheld fella will do the trick just fine.

Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until the cream cheese is fully incorporated. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to a few days. It's best when it's a little cold.

Serve with:

- Ruffles or Wavy Lays potato chips (There is some disagreement within the family on which is best.)  
- Fritos corn chips  
- Bugles  
- Pretzels  
- Vegetables if you're feeling healthy  

Also, keep this recipe on the down low. It is a family secret, after all.
