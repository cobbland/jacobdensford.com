# Newsletter

I've been spending some time trying to figure out what this newsletter should be.

This newsletter is the connective tissue of my blog posts--it gives them context.

Consider switching to a different newsletter platform. [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) seems like a good option and, if not, they have a great list of all the other platforms and how they compare.
