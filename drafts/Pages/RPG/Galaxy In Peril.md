Galaxy in Peril is a tabletop roleplaying game about desperate adventurers trying to save the galaxy. It is based on [Trophy](https://trophyrpg.com/) by Jesse Ross.

## Characters

Each character has a name, a background, several skills, some equipment, a driving motivation, and a worst Outcome.

Your **name** is what people call you. It could be the name you were born with or a nickname you picked up along the way.

Your **background** is what you've done with your life. It's what you were doing before you started down this adventurous path, and it might be what you return to when it's all over. If you're lucky.

Your **skills** are what you're good at. They're broad abilities you've picked up over the years and learned to apply to tricky situations.

You have **equipment**. They're the tools you use to get the job done.

Your **motivation** is what drives you. It's the one thing you want more than anything else in the galaxy. If you're doing things right, every major action you take brings you one step closer to fulfilling your motivation. *Maybe change "motivation" to "best outcome".*

Often times, a person's **worst outcome** will simply be death. But not for you. For you, there is a fate much worse than death. You will try to avoid this at all costs. But it's also strangely alluring. The road to destruction is paved in gold.

To **create a character**, first choose a background. Then select a name from your background. Then choose two skills from your background and one from either your background or a different background. Then choose two pieces of equipment from your background and one from either your background or a different background. Then choose a motivation from your background. Lastly, choose a worst outcome from your background. (Optionally and at the GM's discretion, you may make up your own in any case.)

## Gaining New Skills

Whenever you succeed at a task at which you weren't previously proficient, you may spend 3 experience to add it as a skill. You may also purchase training in a skill that you haven't succeed with previously if you can find a relevant teacher. In such a case, you still must spend 3 experience. You can never know more than 12 skills at one time.

## Gaining New Equipment

Some equipment can be found while adventuring. Other equipment must be purchased from relevant vendors. You can never carry more than 12 pieces of equipment at one time.

## Experience

Any time you follow your motivation despite the danger, gain 1 experience. Also, whenever you commit an act that leads you closer to your worst outcome, gain 1 experience. Call these actions out and the GM and other players will tell you if they're applicable.

At the end of a session, if everyone agrees you generally followed your motivation and had an interesting relationship with your worst outcome, gain 1 experience.

## Harm

You start with 1 harm. You can never remove this harm. It is the cost of living. Once you reach 6 harm, you either die or succumb to your worst outcome, whichever fits better within the fiction. Work with the GM and other players to describe what that looks like. This can happen in the moment or later in the session when narratively appropriate.

Some pieces of equipment can reduce or prevent harm from specific sources. For example, battle armor may be able to absorb 1 harm from a physical fight but would not be able to absorb any harm from an attack on your mind, and would need to be repaired before it would work again.

## Dice

If you want to do something, you're capable of doing it, and there's no real risk involved, you simply do it. However, performing complicated, risky, or perilous tasks requires a roll of the dice. There are three main kinds of rolls: peril rolls, hunt rolls, and combat rolls. There are also help or hinder rolls, bargain rolls, and reduction rolls.

### Peril Roll

When you attempt a risky task, say what you hope will happen and ask the GM and the other players what could possibly go wrong. Then gather 6-sided dice.

Take a light-colored die:

- if the task is something someone with your background would reasonably be able to do.
- if you have a relevant skill or piece of equipment.

Take a dark-colored die:

- if you're willing to risk succumbing to your worst outcome or being harmed in some other way.

Roll the dice. If your highest die is a:

- 1-3, you fail, and things get worse. The GM describes how. The GM may also allow you  to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way.
- 4-5, you succeed, but there's some kind of complication. The GM describes the complication, then you describe how you succeed.
- 6, you succeed. Describe how.

If your highest die is a dark die, and the dark die is higher than your current harm, add 1 to your harm. When you do, work with the GM and other players to describe what befell you.

If you are unhappy with your roll and any dark die in the roll isn’t the highest die, you may add a dark die to your dice pool and re-roll them all. You may keep adding a dark die and re-rolling until you’re satisfied with your result or until a dark die is the highest die in your roll.

### Hunt Roll

When you press ever deeper in the pursuit of a specific and immediate goal, say how you are exploring the environment, then gather 6-sided dice.

Take a light-colored die:

- for exploring the world and asking the GM questions about it.
- if you have a skill or piece of equipment that would make your hunt easier.

Roll the dice. If your highest die is a:

- 1, you lose all your tokens and encounter a challenge.
- 2-3, you encounter a challenge.
- 4-5, take 1 token, but you also encounter a challenge.
- 6, take 1 token.

Spend 1 token to find something useful or valuable.

Spend 3 tokens to achieve your goal.

### Combat Roll

When you attempt to defeat a foe, you may combine your efforts with your companions. Say how you are attacking and how you are exposing yourself to injury, then gather six-sided dice.

Take a dark-colored die:

- for each player participating in the roll.
- for each piece of equipment that grants a bonus die against this type of enemy.

Roll the dice. 

- Each die that results in a 4-6 deals 1 harm to the enemy.
- Each die that results in the same number as your current harm deals 1 harm to you.

If the harm dealt was not enough to defeat the enemy, re-roll the dice and add the new harm to the previous, both to them and to you. You may keep re-rolling until the enemy is defeated or you give up the fight. (Retreating from an incomplete fight may trigger peril rolls or other consequences.)

### Help or Hinder Roll

When another player makes a roll, you may offer to help improve their odds of success if you would reasonably be able to do so using your skills or equipment. Say how you help them and roll a light die when they roll. They may include your light die's result when considering their overall success. However, your character is now tied to any negative outcome that befalls them.

When another player makes a roll, you may attempt to prevent them from succeeding if you would reasonably be able to do so using your skills or equipment. Say how you hinder them and roll a dark die when they roll. If your dark die is higher than their highest die, they must either fail their roll or accept your dark die as their highest die, along with the consequences that come with it. If your dark die is not their highest die and it is higher than your current harm, add 1 to your harm.

### Bargain Roll

When another player makes a roll, if no one is attempting a help or hinder roll, you may offer to make a bargain roll. Say what bargain you're offering and, if it's accepted, roll a light die when they roll. They may include your light die's result when considering their overall success. The bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll.

### Reduction Roll

Whenever you have a moment to catch your breath and have the necessary equipment or facilities to do so, you may attempt to reduce your harm. Roll one light-colored die. If you rolled less than your current harm, reduce your harm by 1. You may continue rolling in this way until you roll higher than your current harm.

## Ships

Ships are like any other piece of equipment, except they don't count towards your 12 equipment limit. In fact, you can store other equipment in them. And people. And they can do other things. They have their own equipment and their own harm. They're kind of a cross between a piece of equipment and a character.

## Running the Game

### Planning an Adventure

Each adventure should have a theme, an overall goal, and at least one set. Each set should have a collection of moments that reflect the theme, a goal, some props, some discoveries, and some complications. 

#### Themes

#### Sets

A set has collection of moments, props, discoveries, and complications, as well as a goal, that mostly reflect the theme of the adventure.

#### Moments and Props

#### Discoveries and Complications

Discoveries can be information or equipment, or even sources for new skills. You can give information about ways to defeat enemies, which can lower their hit number. You can give equipment that assist in defeating enemies, allowing players to roll more dice. Or you can give information and equipment that apply to later parts of the adventure or campaign, or that shed light on the overarching plot.

Complications are anything that prevent the players from achieving their goals. The most obvious complication is combat--a squad of abyss troopers or a young, hungry space dragon. But also consider traps, locked doors, and puzzles of different kinds as good options for complications. Typically, a complication will either require a peril roll or a combat roll.

A combat complication needs a hit number. The hit number indicates how many hits are needed to defeat the enemy. It's also useful to plan several debilities the encounter could potentially cause. If an encounter needs 1 hit, it is considered simple. An adventuring party could probably overcome it in a single roll without taking any hits themselves. An encounter that needs 2 or 3 hits is of easy difficulty. The party might be able to beat it in one roll, but they're just as likely to take a hit or two and need a second roll, or even third roll. An encounter needing 4 or 5 hits is considered medium. It will probably take the party some effort and multiple rolls and hits to overcome. An encounter needing 6 hits is considered hard. A hard encounter could possibly wipe out the party. Anything above 6 hits is going to be quite a challenge.
