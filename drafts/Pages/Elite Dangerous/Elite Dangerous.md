# Elite Dangerous

*A collection of links and things for reference purposes. (Will be cleaned up eventually but right now they're just pasted in from a series of emails.)*

The two best introduction guides I've seen so far:

Here is a collection of all the good guides and tools I've found so far. I've included all of them that seem to still be active and aren't designed like trash. Also, I've organized them but there is some overlap because many of them contain multiple tools. (I've put asterisks next to the ones you should definitely check out first.)

A few more links and things. First, systems we might call home. Then, more apps.

Here is a list of systems within 100ly of Dromi that are Alliance affiliated with high tech markets (more/better ships and components):

    Nuakea
    Ross 490
    CE Bootis
    Xi Ursae Majoris*
    Oshepra*
    Mabe
    LHS 350
    Parjanya*
    Leesti*
    45 c Bootis*
    Ross 835

* My favorites.

The capital of the Alliance is Alioth. You need a permit to enter that system. To get it, you must become allied with the Alioth Independents faction. The best system to do that in is 78 Ursae Majoris, which is 82ly from Sol (for what that's worth).

A few more Elite Dangerous links desktop application edition. (Again, I don't expect you to go through all of these right away. It's just nice to have them for when we need them.)

EDEngineer - https://github.com/msarilar/EDEngineer
We don't need this yet, but we might find it useful once we're working on collecting engineering components.

EDDN - https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN
This is not something we need personally, but it is the back end that almost all the other tools get their data from. It asks players to use one of a number of apps if they want to contribute data, which I think we should.

EDMarketConnector - https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector
Speaking of contributing data to the EDDN, this app does that. It's the simplest app you can use to contribute data. It runs in the background and does nothing else. (It can also connect and send data to a number of other tools we might someday use. I'm installing this one right now.)

EDDiscovery - https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery
This is a desktop application that shows you so, so much information about everything around you in Elite Dangerous. You can also use it to issue commands back into the game from a second computer or a phone or tablet or something like that. Looks really neat. I'll probably try it out sometime, but not right away. (It can also upload data to the EDDN, so it would replace the previous app, probably.)

Trade Dangerous - https://github.com/eyeonus/Trade-Dangerous
This is a python scrip that can generate very, very intricate and optimized trade routes. (There is also a front end for it here.) Very interested in giving this a go at some point.

EDRefCard - https://edrefcard.info/
This one isn't an app. It's a website that can generate a custom control reference sheet. Might be handy to have up on the second monitor for figuring out what button to press for those less used commands. (I'm having a hard time finding which .binds file is the one I'm using so I'll mess with this more later. In the meantime, I've attached reference image that shows what all the buttons on the T16000MFCS HOTAS are named.)

We need a new home base. I present to you five options. The criteria were that the station was within about five hundred light seconds of the jump point, that it had everything to A level our current fleet—including armor options, that it wasn't a Federation system or a system that needs a permit we can't easily get, and that it wasn't on a planet's surface.

Here they are:

- Low Orbital > LHS 2764a
- Strekalov Hub > Punna
- Vittori Gateway > Rudranbarii
- Covey Orbital > HIP 59772
- Carnera Station > Shantereri

They each have some pros and cons. For example, two of them are Alliance systems, which I'd consider a pro. But one of them is a dictatorship—a con. We also should consider which powerplayer we want to support, if any, because that could factor into our decision, as well.

We'll tour them this evening and pick our favorite. Let me know if you have any to add to the list.
