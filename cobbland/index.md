# Welcome

Cobb Land (or Cobbland, cobbland, cobb.land, et cetera) is me, [Jacob Densford](/)â€”a writer, artist, and game designer currently dwelling in the foothills of Appalachia.

In the menu above (and here) you will find links to [the games I've made](https://cobbland.itch.io/), to [my professional GM profile](https://startplaying.games/gm/cobbland) (Hire me to run games for you!), and to [my D&D house rules and world bible](https://www.legendkeeper.com/app/clrtk3as00lyk0jn1hggm6inr).
