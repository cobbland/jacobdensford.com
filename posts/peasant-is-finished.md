I finally finished developing my little tabletop roleplaying game called Peasant. It’s a single-page game of fantasy adventure (or misadventure, considering peasants usually have fewer than four hit points) for one-shots or introducing new players to D&D.

The main gimmick of the game—and one I’m very excited about—is its fast and simple character generation. You roll a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 all at once, consult some charts, and you’re done. It actually takes less than a minute. And after surviving a session, your peasant can be leveled up into a full fledged adventurer using the core rules of D&D.

Download the game [over on its itch.io page](https://cobbland.itch.io/peasant), where you’ll find two versions: one that’s compatible with the 2014 rules of D&D 5E and the other compatible with the 2024 rules. (I plan on eventually making a version that’s compatible with the old B/X rules as well, by way of OSE.) Please [let me know](/contact/) how it goes if you play it.
