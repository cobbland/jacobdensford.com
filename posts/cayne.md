![Cayne](/images/cayne.png)

I like point & click adventure games. At least, I think I do. I also assume I must like horror games because that’s pretty much all Steam recommends for me to play. And I’ve been meaning to play something from [The Brotherhood](https://www.thebrotherhoodgames.com/) ever since I backed a Kickstarter of theirs a few years ago. The internet says I can beat [Cayne](https://www.thebrotherhoodgames.com/studio/cayne/) in less than three hours, so here I go.

You ever fall asleep in a friendly hospital and wake up in a body horror nightmare operating room? That’s how Cayne starts out. Also, you’re extremely pregnant. And the only way to survive is to use the wrench on the ID card, apply mutant milk as an adhesive, and then take all of that and insert it into a computer to access the secret code you need to open the door to the chamber that holds that other item you need to open the other door. Do that, or something like it, five more times and you beat the game. It’s creepy, it’s gross, and the story is actually pretty compelling.

How long did I last before I looked up a walkthrough? Buddy, I couldn’t even solve the first puzzle. I’m not good at point & click adventure games, as it turns out. And I’m disproportionately affected by horror, especially body horror. Still, not a bad way to spend a couple hours. **I recommend it.**

*The regular edition of this game is free on both [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/cayne) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/532840/CAYNE/), so check it out!*
