![Me and Sai getting married.](/images/S__71090182.jpg)

One year and a week ago, I started talking to someone on a dating app. Our daily messages to each other quickly grew to letter-length missives. Within a week, we’d exchanged phone numbers. A week or so after that, we were planning to meet. Several months of spending time together almost daily later, we were engaged. And eight months after meeting, we were married.

I’ve always heard people say, “when you know, you know.” In the past, that phrase rang meaningless to me—just something happily married people said while looking all goo-goo gah-gah at each other. Turns out, they were right. When you know, you really do just know.

This past summer began with a simple, private ceremony under a tree in a park. From there, it proceeded more perfectly than I could have imagined. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, and I look forward to every day.

(I know you’re reading this, Sai. Thanks for being my biggest supporter—both of my silly little website and of me in general. Your drive, compassion, and creativity are a constant inspiration. I admire you, and I love you!)
