<p>Like running in a sauna. I was soaked by the end&mdash;sweat still dripping down my face as I made coffee.</p>

<p>(It's true what they say: a little bit of salt brings out the flavor.)</p>

<p>It's summer, so I couldn't help revisiting my old Cop Drama playlist. I decided to flesh it out a bit more&mdash;make it longer and slightly less focused. I added some songs from the old and new Top Gun movies, among other things. I wouldn't say it's better than <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4e6hiaS9C5n2NrplSoggv2">the original</a>. And it might even be worse. But I wanted some new songs, damnit!</p>

<p>It is still a work in progress. I'm adding and removing things every time I open it up.</p>

<p>Take a listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6by3Ki742SPkQAszmXdZCR">Cop Drama Extended Edition</a> on Spotify.</p>

<p>(As always, ACAB.)</p>

<p>This past week was a mostly good one for <a href="https://jacobdensford.com/projects/centauri-womb/">the novel</a>. Wrote half a chapter. Working hard to flesh out Nel's relationships with the oasis dwellers and build some motivation for what's to come. I think it's working.</p>
