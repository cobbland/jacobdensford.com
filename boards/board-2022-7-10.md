<p>But I did it anyway!</p>

<p>Like running in a suana. I was soaked by the end&mdash;sweat still dripping down my face as I made coffee.</p>

<p>(It's true what they say: a little bit of salt brings out the flavors.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>It's summer, so I couldn't help revisiting my old Cop Drama playlist. I decided to flesh it out a bit more&mdash;make it longer and slighly less focused. I added some songs from the old and new Top Gun movies, among other things.</p>

<p>It's still a work in progress. I'm still adding and removing things every time I open it up.</p>

<p>Take a listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6by3Ki742SPkQAszmXdZCR">Cop Drama Extended Edition</a> on Spotify.</p>

<p>(Still, ACAB.)</p>
