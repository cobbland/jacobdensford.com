# Playing the Game

Most of the time, you will simply be saying what you do in response to the world described by the facilitator. Sometimes, you will roll dice.

## Tests

Whenever you attempt to do something that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain, roll a **test**. Collect dice: one from your relevant attribute and one, if any, from a relevant skill. Roll, counting each die's result individually.

Roll|Result
:--|:--
1-3|Miss
4-6|Weak Hit
7-9|Hit
10-12|Strong Hit

The test passes if you roll at least one **hit** of any kind. (Rarely, especially difficult tests might require two or more hits.)

If a die is a **weak hit**, there is also an unforeseen consequence. If a die is a **strong hit**, there is also an unanticipated benefit.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You may choose to accept extra trouble in exchange for passing a failed test.

### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. In a tie, strong hits beat hits beat weak hits, higher numbers beat lower, then bigger dice beat smaller.

### Help

When someone else makes a test, you may roll a relevant skill die and add your hit to their test.

### Modifying Tests

When you roll a test, you may modify it by spending points from the relevant attribute's pool. Spend 2 points to increase a weak hit to a hit or a hit to a strong hit, 4 to turn a miss into a hit, or 6 to add an additional hit to your roll.

## Hirelings

You can employ hirelings to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings have a d4 in every attribute and a d4 in one skill. When performing a relevant test, you may add your hireling's skill die to your roll.

Hirelings cost 5 coin per day. If not paid upfront, roll a WIL test on the table below whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous to determine their reaction.

Roll|Hireling
:--|:--
1-3|Flee
4-6|Refuse
7-9|Hesitate
10-12|Cooperate

## Reactions

When you encounter a nonplayer character (NPC) who's disposition towards you is not obvious, roll a WIL test on the table below to determine their reaction.

Roll|Reaction
:--|:--
1-3|Hostile
4-6|Wary
7-9|Friendly
10-12|Helpful

## Combat

Combat involves a series of **rounds** made up of **turns**. A round lasts long enough for everyone to make a test and traverse a room--about six seconds. Each side acts as a group, taking their turns together.

During your turn, you may move and make a test, often an attack. Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins deals their hits as harm.

If it isn't obvious, make an INT test on the initiative table to determine which side takes their turns first.

Roll|Initiative
:--|:--
1-3|Enemies go twice
4-6|Enemies begin
7-9|PCs begin
10-12|PCs go twice

## Morale

When you defeat an enemy leader, reduce their force by half, or reduce a lone enemies PP by half, roll a WIL test on the morale table to see what the surviving enemies do.

Roll|Morale
:--|:--
1-3|Fight
4-6|Retreat
7-9|Flee
10-12|Surender

## Harm, Healing, and Death

Each attribute has a point pool (or PP) that is the size of its die. Harm subtracts points and healing refills them.

When a pool is depleted, reduce the attribute's die by one and refill the now smaller pool. Each time your attribute is reduced in such a way, gain a wound--a lasting mark or sign of your struggle.

When an attribute is reduced below d4, roll on the death table. Regardless of the outcome, tests can no longer be made using this attribute, and its PP is zero.

d4|Death Result
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d6 hours unless treated
4|Dead in 1d8 days unless treated

Whenever you take about an hour to rest and eat or drink, you may heal a point pool by succeeding on a test using its attribute. When you rest for the night on a full stomach, the test automatically succeeds. Returning a reduced attribute die to normal requires a week of comfortable rest with adequate food and drink.
