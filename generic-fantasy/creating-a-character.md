**Example character:** *Jane is a charming young woman with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time.*

## Attributes

You have three attributes:

- **Body (BOD):** Constitution, grit, reflexes, strength
- **Intellect (INT):** Aim, cunning, intelligence, perception
- **Willpower (WIL):** Force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasiveness

Roll on the following table for each attribute and assign dice. Alternatively, assign a d6 to each attribute, or assign an array of d4, d6, and d8. An attribute's value ranges from d4 to d12.

d8|Attribute Die
:--|:--
1-2|d4
3-6|d6
7-8|d8

You have a point pool (or PP) for each attribute consisting of as many points as the attribute's die.

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gets a d6 in BOD, a d8 in INT, and a d4 in WIL. She has a PP of 6 in BOD, 8 in INT, and 4 in WIL.*

## Classes

There are six classes, each specializing in one or more attributes.

Choose one of the six classes. You must have at least a d8 in the class's main attribute(s). Gain one of your class's feats.

If none of your attributes are high enough, skip this section and gain a background instead.

**Example character:** *Jane takes the thief class since she rolled a d8 for her INT. From her class, she chooses* sneak attack.

### Fighter

As a fighter, your main attribute is BOD.

#### Fighter Feats

- **Berserk:** When you hit and deal harm, you may make additional tests to deal harm until you fail
- **Precise Strike:** When you hit and deal harm, you may turn strong hits into double harm
- **Protect:** You may take the BOD harm that someone nearby would have taken instead of them

### Thief

As a thief, your main attribute is INT.

#### Thief Feats

- **Expertise:** You may spend 2 INT in order to reroll skill dice
- **Jack of all Trades:** You may spend 2 INT to roll a d4 with any skill
- **Sneak Attack:** When you hit and deal harm to someone engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence, you may deal double harm

### Sage

As a sage, your main attribute is WIL.

#### Sage Feats

- **Counterspell:** You may force a WIL contest to prevent someone from casting a spell
- **Spellcasting:** You may cast spells and you gain one spell--whenever taking the "gain feat" option from the XP table, you may gain another spell instead
- **Spellshield:** You may take harm to WIL instead of BOD or INT

### Battle Mage

As a battle mage, your main attributes are BOD and WIL.

You may gain warrior and sage feats.

## Equipment
