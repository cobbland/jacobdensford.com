**v0.1**

Generic Fantasy (working title) is a tabletop roleplaying game for one facilitator and at least one other player. Players act as adventurers and heroes exploring a dangerous and magical world. The facilitator plays that world.

This game was written with the following principles in mind:

- **Rullings over rules**
- **Fiction over mechanics**

<h2 id="player-characters">Creating a Character</h2>

You are an adventurer in a world full of magic and danger.

You have a **name**, **style**, **class** or **background**, **motivation**, **flaw**, and a few distinct **looks**. You also have three **attributes**, a number of **skills**, and some **equipment**.

**Example character:** *Jane is a charming young woman with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time.*

### Attributes

You have three attributes:

- **Body (BOD):** Constitution, grit, reflexes, strength, etc
- **Intellect (INT):** Aim, cunning, intelligence, perception, etc
- **Willpower (WIL):** Force of will, leadership, magical potential, persuasion, etc

Roll on the following table for each attribute and assign dice. Alternatively, assign a d6 to each attribute, or assign an array of d4, d6, and d8. An attribute's value ranges from d4 to d12.

d8|Attribute Die
:--|:--
1-2|d4
3-6|d6
7-8|d8

You have a health point (or HP) pool for each attribute consisting of as many points as the attribute's die.

**Example character:** *Jane rolls and gets a d6 in BOD, a d8 in INT, and a d4 in WIL. She has an HP pool of 6 in BOD, 8 in INT, and 4 in WIL.*

### Classes

There are six classes, each specializing in one or more attributes.

Choose one of the six classes. You must have at least a d8 in the class's main attribute(s). Gain one of your class's feats.

If none of your attributes are high enough, skip this section and gain a background instead.

**Example character:** *Jane takes the thief class since she rolled a d8 for her INT. From her class, she chooses* sneak attack.

#### Fighter

As a fighter, your main attribute is body.

##### Fighter Feats

- **Berserk:** When you hit and deal harm, you may make additional tests to deal harm until you fail
- **Precise Strike** When you hit and deal harm, you may turn strong hits into double harm
- **Protect:** You may take the BOD harm that someone nearby would have taken instead of them

#### Thief

As a thief, your main attribute is intellect.

##### Thief Feats

- **Expertise:** You may spend 2 INT HP in order to reroll skill dice
- **Jack of all Trades:** You may spend 2 INT HP to roll a d4 with any skill
- **Sneak Attack:** When you hit and deal harm to someone engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence, you may deal double harm

#### Sage

As a sage, your main attribute is willpower.

##### Sage Feats

- **Counterspell:** You may force a WIL contest to prevent someone from casting a spell
- **Spellcasting:** You may cast spells and you gain one spell--whenever taking the "gain feat" option from the XP table, you may gain another spell instead
- **Spellshield:** You may take harm to WIL instead of BOD or INT

#### Battle Mage

As a battle mage, your main attributes are body and willpower.

You may gain warrior and sage feats.

#### Arcane Trickster

As an arcane trickster, your main attributes are intellect and willpower.

You may gain thief and mage feats.

#### Warrior Poet

As a warrior poet, your main attributes are body and intellect.

You may gain fighter and thief feats.

There are ten skills. Roll on the skill die table and then the skill table three times, assigning each skill die to the rolled skill. Alternatively, assign a d6 to three skills, or assign an array of d4, d6, and d8. Once gained, a skill's value ranges from d4 to d12.

### Character Advancement

You gain **experience points** (or XP) whenever you allow your style, motivation, or flaw to put you in a tight spot.

Add your earned XP to your XP track. At each die number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20), you may roll that die on the XP table and reduce your XP to the next die down.

Roll|XP Result
:--|---
1|Gain nothing and lose d8 XP
2-3|Gain nothing and lose d4 XP
4-6|Gain a new class feat or gain a class
7-9|Increase a skill's die or gain a new skill at d4
10-12|Gain a feat from a different class or switch classes
13-19|Increase an attribute's die
20|Choose one and reroll

**Example Character:**

*Jane is a charming thief with messy hair, windburnt skin, and darting eyes. She seeks wealth to pay off her family's debts. She will never trust again after what happened last time.*

*BOD: d6 -- 6/6 HP (2/2 AP) | ^INT^: d8 -- 8/8 HP | WIL: d4 -- 4/4 HP*

*Discernment: d8, Ranged: d6, Skullduggery: d4*

*Sneak Attack: Deal double harm when attacking an enemy who is engaged with someone else or who is unaware of your presence*

*Equipment (5/10 slots): light armor (2 AP, 2 slots), dagger (1 harm), shortbow (1 harm), arrows (20), lockpicks, 10 coin*

*XP: 0 (roll on 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20)*

<h2 id="playing">Playing the Game</h2>

### Tests

Whenever you attempt to do something that you could reasonably accomplish but the outcome is uncertain, roll a **test**. Collect dice: one from your relevant attribute and one, if any, from a relevant skill. Roll, counting each die's result individually.

Roll|Result
:--|:--
1-3|Miss
4-6|Weak Hit (Hit-)
7-9|Hit
10-12|Strong Hit (Hit+)

The test passes if you roll at least one **hit**. (Rarely, especially difficult tests might require two or more hits.)

If a die is a **weak hit**, there is an unforeseen consequence. If a die is a **strong hit**, there is an unanticipated benefit.

If none of the dice hit, the test fails. You may choose to accept extra trouble in exchange for passing a failed test.

#### Modifying Tests

You may use your class's main attribute(s) in a special way: you may spend 2 HP to increase a weak hit to a hit or a hit to a strong hit, 4 HP to turn a miss into a hit, or 6 HP to add an additional hit to your roll.

#### Help

When someone else makes a test, you may roll a relevant skill die and add your hit to their test.

#### Contests

When you test against someone, you each collect dice as normal and roll. Whoever has the most hits wins. In a tie, strong hits beat hits beat weak hits, higher numbers beat lower, then bigger dice beat smaller.

##### Combat

Combat involves a series of rounds made up of turns. A round lasts long enough to make a test and traverse a room--about six seconds.

An initiative contest decides the order of turns in a round. Rounds continue until everyone has either surrendered, fled, or died.

Attacking is a contest. Whoever wins each attack contest deals their hits as harm.

### Health Points, Death, and Healing

Each attribute has a health point (or HP) pool that is the size of its die. When a pool is depleted, reduce the attribute's die by one and refill the pool. Each time your attribute is reduced in such a way, gain a wound--a lasting mark or sign of your struggle.

When an attribute is reduced below d4, tests can no longer be made with it and its HP pool is zero. Roll on the death table.

d4|Death Result
:--|---
1|Dead
2|Dead in 1d4 rounds unless treated
3|Dead in 1d6 hours unless treated
4|Dead in 1d8 days unless treated

Whenever you take about an hour to rest and eat or drink, you may replenish an HP pool by succeeding on a test using its attribute. When you rest for the night on a full stomach, the test automatically succeeds. Returning a reduced attribute die to normal requires a week of comfortable rest with adequate food and drink.
