## About me

![A picture of me standing by my Prius and holding a Jar Jar Binks tiki mug.](/images/jarjarmug.png)

I’m a writer who has yet to publish anything, currently traveling the country in my Prius-camper (which is crazy because I hate driving).

I aspire to be a lot of things: An author of science fiction, writing stories that reach beyond the rumored coming dystopia to find a sustainable future. A game designer who makes interactive narratives and tabletop roleplaying games that show us what we are when we’re alone and what we can be when we’re together. A musician exploring the intersection of synthesis, acoustic instruments, and field recordings; writing folk music for when the sky becomes the color of television tuned to a dead channel. A contributor to a more decentralized internet and a less disposable world.

## About this website

I made this website from scratch and generated it using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Poke around as much as you want. And please [let me know](https://github.com/jacobdensford/jacobdensford.com) if you find anything that’s broken. I’m very new to all this.

This website uses the fonts [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/), [Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin), and [Lapti Nek](https://aurekfonts.github.io/?font=LaptiNekAF). The background color is called [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte)&mdash;it’s the average color of the universe.
