## About me

![A picture of me standing by my Prius and holding a Jar Jar Binks tiki mug.](/images/jarjarmug.jpeg)

I’m a writer who has yet to publish anything, currently traveling the country in my Prius-turned-camper (which is crazy because I hate driving).

I write fiction—mostly science fiction. I also dabble in making other things: tabletop games, video games, music, etc.

## About this website

I made this website from scratch and generated it using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Poke around as much as you want. And please [let me know](https://github.com/jacobdensford/jacobdensford.com) if you find anything that’s broken. I’m very new to all this.

This website uses the fonts [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/), [Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin), and [Lapti Nek](https://aurekfonts.github.io/?font=LaptiNekAF). The background color is called [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte)&mdash;it’s the average color of the universe.
