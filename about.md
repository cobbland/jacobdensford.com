## About me

I’m a writer who has yet to publish anything, currently traveling the country in my Prius-turned-camper (which is crazy because I hate driving).

I write fiction—mostly science fiction. I also dabble in making other things: tabletop games, video games, music, etc.

## About this website

It's a mess; I know. But I'm working on it. I wrote it/am writing it from scratch&mdash;code and all. Poke around as much as you want. And please [let me know](https://github.com/jacobdensford/jacobdensford.github.io) if you find anything that's broken.

This website uses the fonts [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/) and [Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin). The background color is called [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte)&mdash;it's the average color of the universe.
