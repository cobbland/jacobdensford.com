## About me

![A picture of me standing by my Prius and holding a Jar Jar Binks tiki mug.](/images/jarjarmug.png)

I’m a writer and game designer who has yet to publish anything, currently dwelling in the foothills of Appalachia.

I aspire to be a lot of things: An author of science fiction, writing stories that reach beyond the rumored coming dystopia to find a sustainable future. A game designer who makes interactive narratives and tabletop roleplaying games that show us what we are when we’re alone and what we can be when we’re together. A contributor to a more decentralized internet and a less disposable world.
